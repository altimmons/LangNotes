<h5>Basic Definitions</h5>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> I have always believed that engineering is the process of
      designing/implementing solutions to any problem facing a person or person's.</span> The dictionary defines
   Engineering as " <span style="color: #808080;">the application of science and mathematics by which the properties of
      matter and the sources of energy in nature are made useful to people</span>" <a href="#fn1"
      style="font-family: Courier New , Courier , mono; font-size: smaller; font-style: oblique; vertical-align: super; color: #447711;">[1]</a>.
   Another, perhaps more applicable definition, with its emphasis on 'design, planning, and implementation based on
   scientific principle' is the Wikipedia intro blurb for the <em>Engineering</em> article :</p>
<blockquote>
   <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span
                  style="font-family: helvetica;">"Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build
                  machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.
                  <sup>[(3)]</sup> The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of
                  engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied
                  science, and types of application. "<a href="#fn2"
                     style="font-family: Courier New , Courier , mono; font-size: smaller; font-style: oblique; vertical-align: super; color: #447711;"><span
                        style="color: #808080;">[2]</span></a></span></span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition borrows from two sources, in the former sentence we have another dictionary definition, this time the
   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cambridge English Dictionary</span> <a href="#fn3"
      style="font-family: Courier New , Courier , mono; font-size: smaller; font-style: oblique; vertical-align: super; color: #447711;">[3],</a><a
      href="#fn4"
      style="font-family: Courier New , Courier , mono; font-size: smaller; font-style: oblique; vertical-align: super; color: #447711;">[4]</a>,
   and the "About" page for the <em>IAENG</em> (International Association of Engineers) website for the latter.
   Interestingly, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Merriam-Webster</span> definition seems lifted from this
   site's definition, or vice-versa.</p>
<h5>Discussion on the Above and Exposition of Ideals</h5>
<h6>The General Case</h6>
<p>Based on these descriptions, that engineering is the application of science or mathematics to solve a (generally)
   well-defined and circumscribed problem. The term itself is inexact, as there are many different disciplines of
   "Engineering". </p>

      is the process by which engineers research, analyze, develop, test, modify and maintain a certain type of product.
      Regardless of the type of engineering, whether mechanical, software, chemical, environmental and etc. the process
      always involves designing and constructing a final product. (abscription?). </span></p>
<p></p>It may be first posited that generally, science is the exploration of the natural world, and its precise description,
      classification, enumeration using subject appropriate terms. In addition, this science is also the elucidation of
      the <em>terra incognita </em>in a given field. In the general sense, the term '&lt;<em>x&gt; science'</em>, often
      refers to, in general meaning<em>, the "pure" science. </em>To know for the sake of knowing, for knowing itself
      has value. As declared by Dutch
                  theologian, Cornelius Jansen (1585–1638), 'a desire for knowledge was one form of
         concupiscence, and he argued that from this “illness … arises the investigation of nature's secrets (which are
         irrelevant to us), knowledge of which is useless, and which men do not wish to know except for the sake of
         knowing them”.' </p>

      To each reasonably defined field of science, <br /></p>
