## Reference


Character classes
- `.` - any character except newline
- `\w\d\s` - word, digit, whitespace
- `\W\D\S` - not word, digit, whitespace
- `[abc]` - any of a, b, or c
- `[^abc]` - not a, b, or c
- `[a-g]` - character between a & g
Anchors
- `^abc$` - start / end of the string
- `\b\B` - word, not-word boundary
Escaped characters
- `\.\*\\` - escaped special characters
- `\t\n\r` - tab, linefeed, carriage return
Groups & Lookaround
- `(abc)` - capture group
- `\1` - backreference to group #1
- `(?:abc)` - non-capturing group
- `(?=abc)` - positive lookahead
- `(?!abc)` - negative lookahead
Quantifiers & Alternation
- `a*a+a?` - 0 or more, 1 or more, 0 or 1
- `a{5}a{2,}` - exactly five, two or more
- `a{1,3}` - between one & three
- `a+?a{2,}?` - match as few as possible
- `ab|cd` - match ab or cd
Substitution
- `$&` -  match
- `$1` -  capture group
- ```$` ``` -  (backtick) before match
- `$'` - (single quote) after match
- `$$` - escaped `$`
- `\n` - other escaped chars






(?=ABC) positive lookahead - Matches a group after the main expression without including it in the result.

    Example

        \d(?=px)
        1pt 2px 3em 4px  # matches 2 and 4

(?!ABC) negative lookahead - Specifies a group that can not match after the main expression (if it matches, the result is discarded).

    Example

        \d(?!px)
        1pt 2px 3em 4px # matches 1 and 3
Flags
- `i` - ignore case
- `g` - global search - Retain the index of the last match, allowing subsequent searches to start from the end of the previous match.
- `m` - multiline - When the multiline flag is enabled, beginning and end anchors (`^` and `$`) will match the start and end of a line, instead of the start and end of the whole string.
- `u` - unicode - When the unicode flag is enabled, you can use extended unicode escapes in the form `\x{FFFFF}`.
- `y` - sticky - The expression will only match from its lastIndex position and ignores the global (g) flag if set. Because each search in RegExr is discrete, this flag has no further impact on the displayed results.

Expression flags change how the expression is interpreted. Flags follow the closing forward slash of the expression (ex. /.+/igm ).

!!!note Patterns such as `/^[\s\S]+$/m` may return matches that span multiple lines because the anchors will match the start/end of any line.

!!!Note Note- The link- `Microsoft VS RegExp` suggests an older easier form of RegExp thats worth checking out if this isnt working

- Wildcards
  - `.` - 1   match a single char (any, except new line `\n`)
  - `*` - 0+  - zero or more occurances.
  - `+` - 1+  -one or more occurances.  Requires its occurance.
  - `?` - match 0 or more, but as few characters as possible (?).
    - `.+`  = one or more of any char **As above- this is a (non-null) Wildcard**
    - `.*` = zero or more of any char.  **This is a wildcard functionally**
    - `*?`,`+?`, `??`, `{#...}?` Lazy modifiers of the above.
  - {#} - specify the number of times something *preceeding* should occur.  Goes after. `[0-9]{3} = 142 or 999`
    - {#,#} - specify a range of occurances.  e.g. [0-9]{2,4}  match 10 - 9999
    - {#,} - match at least # times
- Anchors
  - `^` - anchor to front
  - `\r?$` -anchor to rear.  Old character was just `$`
    - this just says match a carriage return or not if it exists.  This has gotten me on linux once.
- Parens and brackets
  - [...] - give characters to match.
    - [\], [c] - match a single char
    - [a-f], [0-9] - match a range
    - [pre], [.)-] - match a single character in a set. [abc] = a, b, c not d, matches a in aa.
  - (...) - specify a string to search for
    - (...) -> `\1` define a pattern then Reference it later (in the same pattern) with \1 (\2, \3) etc.  `({3}[x])z\1 = xxxzxxx`
    - (...) -> `$1` - in replacements, VS 2011+ replaced \1 with $1.
- Logic
  - `?!` = NOT , `real(?!ity)` matched real and really but not reality.
  - [^...] - NOT in set - as above for brackets, but invalidates `be[^abc]` does not match bear but would match bee.
  - `|` = OR - Match either the sequence before or after. `([0-9]|[a-f]|[^g-z])` - to find hex `#([0-9]|[a-f]){6}` find hex colors
- Types
  - `(\b\S+\s?){1,}`  USEFUL- find words - start at word boundary -repeat to go to non-space- find 0 or 1 space- then all of it {1,}- one or more words.
  - `\p{...}` match a type
  - `\b` -specifies a word boundary- usually a space `\bin` matches inside but not bin.
  - `\r?\n` - line break carriage return.   This is system independent - 0 or more \r (returns), then \n.  Or at least Unix/Win
  - `(?([^\r\n])\s)` Whitespace
  - `\d` digit
  - \u#### -unicode (specific char)
  - `((\".+?\")|('.+?'))` = quoted string
  - `\b0[xX]([0-9a-fA-F])\b` matches hex- Matches "0xc67f" but not "0xc67fc67f".
  - `\b[0-9]*\.*[0-9]+\b` int and floats.
- Characters
  - `\` -escape character - e.g. `\.` is a literal `.` not anychar.
  - \b - word boundary
  - \t tab character (\u0009)
  - \r carriage return \u000D
  - \v vert tab
  - \f form feed
  - `\n` new line (\u000A)
  - `\e` escape \u001b
  - `\###` | `\##` matches an **ASCII Character** in Octal | Hex
  - `\cC` matches CtrlC
  - `\octal` 2-3 digit octal character code
  - `\x` hex 2-digit hex character code
  - `\u` hex 4-digit hex character code
  - `\b` Backspace \u0008 NOTE-This is redundant with word boundry, not sure how it'd work.
  - `\e` Escape \u001B
- Classes- generally UPPER CASE is NOT a category.
  - \S -any non-White-Space
  - \s - any whitespace character
  - \D - Matches a nondigit char - equiv to `\P{Nd}`
  - \d - a decimal digit (e.g number 0-9)
    - \d{1,5}- Match from one to five decimal digits.
  - `\w` Alphanumeric ('Word character')
  - \W non word character
  - \p{**} - is in a category
  - \P{**} is NOT in a category

## Group Referencing (Reusing a previously used group)
- `(exp)` Indexed group
- `(?<name>exp)` -  Named group
- `(?<name1-name2>exp)` - Balancing group
- `(?:exp)` - Noncapturing group
- `(?=exp)` - Zero-width positive lookahead
- `(?!exp)` - Zero-width negative lookahead
- `(?<=exp)` - Zero-width positive lookbehind
- `(?<!exp)` - Zero-width negative lookbehind
- `(?>exp)` - Non-backtracking (greedy)
-  `?!` = NOT , `real(?!ity)` matched real and really but not reality.

## Use To substitute
- `$n` - Substring matched by group number n
- `${` - name}     Substring matched by group
- `$$` - Literal $ character
- `$&` - Copy of whole match
- ``  $` `` ([[DollarSign + Backtick]]- Text before the match
- `$'` - Text after the match
- `$+` - Last captured group
- `$` - _   Entire input string

## Conditionals

- `a |b` - Either a or b
- `(?(exp) yes | no)` -> `yes` if exp is matched and  =`no` if exp isn't matched
- `(?(name) yes | no)` -> `yes` if name is matched  and  = `no` if name isn't matched

## Comments
- `(?# comment)` Add inline comment
- `#` Add x-mode comment


## backreferencing
- `\n` - Indexed group
- `\k<name>` - Named group


## Options
- `(?imnsximnsx)` Set or disable the specified options
- `(?imnsximnsx:exp)` Set or disable the specified options within the expression
  - `i` - Case-insensitive
  - `m` - Multiline mode
  - `n` - Explicit (named)
  - `s` - Single-line mode
  - `x` - Ignore white space

Greedy Lazy Matches
0 or more times | `*` Greedy `*?`  Lazy
1 or more times | `+` Greedy  `+?`  Lacy
 `?` |  `??` Lazy 0 or 1 time |
`{n}` `{n}?` Exactly n times
`{n,}` `{n,}?` At least n times
`{n,m}` `{n,m}?` From n to m times

| Greedy    | Lazy       | Matches           |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| `*`       | `*?`       | 0 or more times   |
| `+`       | `+?`       | 1 or more times   |
| `?`       | `??`       | 0 or 1 time       |
| `{`n`}`   | `{`n`}?`   | Exactly n times   |
| `{`n,`}`  | `{`n,`}?`  | At least n times  |
| `{`n,m`}` | `{`n,m`}?` | From n to m times |

Note- `{n,m}` and similar are recorded weird because they disappear from table when entered verbatim, it must be the format of the table code.


The regular expression pattern \b`(?<n2>\d{2}-)?``(?(n2)``\d{7}`|`\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}`)\b is interpreted as shown in the following table.

Pattern  Description
- `\b`  Start at a word boundary.
- `(?<n2>\d{2}-)?` Match zero or one occurrence of two digits followed by a hyphen. Name this capturing group n2.
- `(?(n2)`  Test whether n2 was matched in the input string.
- `)\d{7}`   If n2 was matched, match seven decimal digits.
- `|\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}` If n2 was not matched, match three decimal digits, a hyphen, two decimal digits, another hyphen, and four decimal digits.
- `\b`  Match a word boundary.



### Lookaheads and Lookbehinds

Lookarounds at a glance

When the regular expression engine hits a lookaround expression, it takes a substring reaching from the current position to the start (lookbehind) or end (lookahead) of the original string, and then runs Regex.IsMatch on that substring using the lookaround pattern. Success of this subexpression's result is then determined by whether it's a positive or negative assertion.

Lookarounds at a glance
Lookaround 	Name 	Function
(?=check) 	Positive Lookahead 	Asserts that what immediately follows the current position in the string is "check"
(?<=check) 	Positive Lookbehind 	Asserts that what immediately precedes the current position in the string is "check"
(?!check) 	Negative Lookahead 	Asserts that what immediately follows the current position in the string is not "check"
(?<!check) 	Negative Lookbehind 	Asserts that what immediately precedes the current position in the string is not "check"

| Lookaround | Name                | Function                                                                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (?=check)  | Positive Lookahead  | Asserts that what immediately follows the current position in the string is "check"      |
| (?<=check) | Positive Lookbehind | Asserts that what immediately precedes the current position in the string is "check"     |
| (?!check)  | Negative Lookahead  | Asserts that what immediately follows the current position in the string is not "check"  |
| (?<!check) | Negative Lookbehind | Asserts that what immediately precedes the current position in the string is not "check" |


Once they have matched, atomic groups won't be re-evaluated again, even when the remainder of the pattern fails due to the match. This can significantly improve performance when quantifiers occur within the atomic group or the remainder of the pattern.



### Examples

Verifying Email:

```c#
 public static void Main()
   {
      Stopwatch sw;
      string[] addresses = { "AAAAAAAAAAA@contoso.com",
                             "AAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaa!@contoso.com" };
      // The following regular expression should not actually be used to
      // validate an email address.
      string pattern = @"^[0-9A-Z]([-.\w]*[0-9A-Z])*$";
      string input;

      foreach (var address in addresses) {
         string mailBox = address.Substring(0, address.IndexOf("@"));
         int index = 0;
         for (int ctr = mailBox.Length - 1; ctr >= 0; ctr--) {
            index++;

            input = mailBox.Substring(ctr, index);
            sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
            Match m = Regex.Match(input, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
            sw.Stop();
            if (m.Success)
               Console.WriteLine("{0,2}. Matched '{1,25}' in {2}",
                                 index, m.Value, sw.Elapsed);
            else
               Console.WriteLine("{0,2}. Failed  '{1,25}' in {2}",
                                 index, input, sw.Elapsed);
         }
         Console.WriteLine();

#### My Examples


    ([{]+)(?<in>.*?)([}]+)(\k<in>)

This code had tis weird duplication inside braces.  But not all, some were just in braces.

So I final all the things bracketed by a brack that immedietly match the same thing after.   Like `{ABC}ABC`  It is written such that everything must match,

    {A\cup B=B\cup A}
    {A\cap B=B\cap A}
    Associative property:
    {(A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup (B\cup C)}
    {(A\cap B)\cap C=A\cap (B\cap C)}
    Distributive property:
    {A\cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C)}A\cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C)
    {A\cap (B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)}

Finding a table

`(^\|)(.*?)(\|)(.*?)(\|$)`

!!!example For parsing tables:
    Intention is to find `^| ... | ... |$`

        `(^[\[\_.\:\+\*-\w]*)([\t]{2})(.*?$)` -
    convert input from R into (- `xxxx` - xxxx)


!!!code Convert var: text -
         (^[.$\w\s\(\;\)]*)([:])

!!!note Bold betweem the parentheses (xxx) -> **(xxx)**
            ([(])(.*?)([)])
            **$1$2$3**





!!!note   A series of entries like this:
    It would not continue the match onto the following line for some reason.
        encoding:
        The name of an encoding, default "native.enc". See connections.
        encoding:
        The name of an encoding, default "native.enc". See connections.

        (^[a-z.]+?)(:)([\n^.*])
    and replace with    -
