## Notes

Note for Windows users on 64-bit systems

- Progra~1 = 'Program Files'
- Progra~2 = 'Program Files(x86)'


## VS Code

code _ , where _ is

- `.`(period) Open "Code" **in** *the* Current dir
- `..` prior directory.  

Every directory has 2 members by default - its links in the linked graph. `.` or 'this' and `..` or 'parent'.


## Windows Functions

`msconfig` - get to **safe mode**

### Shell Config

#### Environment Vars

see with `gci env:` in Powershell,

#### Start Menu Location

`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`
`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`
`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`


#### Secret Location of the right click menu
`C:\Users\s163837\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WinX`


### Change the *Send To* Context Menu

[[Win]] + [[R]] -> `shell:sendto`



File Explorer, or Windows Explorer, opens to the SendTo folder for your user account; specifically it's: c:\users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo

[Source](https://www.pcmag.com/news/352810/how-to-customize-the-send-to-menu-in-windows)


Create shortcuts in `c:\users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo` to send files.


!!!Note-you can also add applications.


## Location of Personal Data

### Open/Save Menu

All files opened or saved with the Open/ Save dialog are stored here:


HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\OpenSaveMRU
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\OpenSavePidlMRU

Can be viewed with Nirsoft - OpenSaveFilesView

C:\Documents and Settings\[Your Profile]\Recent

### Folder Settings


Windows uses the following Registry keys to save the folders information:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell (Only in Windows Vista)

### User Assist

Nirsoft - UserAssistView

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist key in the Registry. The UserAssist key contains information about the exe files and links that you open frequently


### Passwords

DataProtectionDecryptor is a powerful tool for Windows that allows you to decrypt passwords and other information encrypted by the DPAPI (Data Protection API) system of Windows operating system.

Here's some examples for passwords and other data encrypted with DPAPI:

Passwords of Microsoft Outlook accounts, stored in the Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Outlook\Profiles or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles (Depending on version of Outlook)
Credentials files of Windows (e.g: C:\Users\[User Profile]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials , C:\Users\[User Profile]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials )
Wireless network keys (Stored inside XML files under C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces )
Passwords in some versions of Internet Explorer, stored in the following Registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2
Passwords stored in the passwords file of Chrome Web browser ('Login Data' file in the profile of Chrome).
Encrypted cookies in Chrome Web browser ('Cookies' file in the profile of Chrome)

## Notes to Be Placed

### Changing Startup OPTIONS

[[Windows]] + [[Pause/Break]] - then "Advanced Settings" -> Then Under Advanced "Startup and Recovery"-
Disable Memory Dump.  You cxan also change Boot Options.

### Stopping Just In Time debugging

To Stop Debugging Queries (An uncaught exception occured do you want to debug?) - Go to services


[Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-using-the-just-in-time-debugger?view=vs-2019#BKMK_Enablingz)

In the Registry Editor window, locate and delete the following registry entries:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\DbgManagedDebugger

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger

If your computer is running a 64-bit operating system, also delete the following registry entries:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\DbgManagedDebugger

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger

Try setting

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\DontShowUI

to 1.
### NoDrives


Hide drive mappings in 'My Computer', Windows Explorer and the standard Open dialog box.

Each letter is one bit more in binary.

So drive A(1) = 1, drive B(2)=2, driveC(3)=4, D=8, E=16 and so on.

Copy the result into the registry to hide the drive letter(s)

User Key:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer]

System Key:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer]

Value Name: NoDrives
Data Type: DWORD

After changing the registry, logoff or reboot so that it takes effect.

Drive mappings hidden with a nodrives registry setting are still available, just type the drive letter into the explorer address bar.


### Setting Explorer to My PC not Quick Access

```batch
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced" /v "LaunchTo" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

To force Windows Error Reporting (WER) to take a crash dump and close the app, instead of prompting you to debug the program, you can set these registry entries:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting]
"ForceQueue"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Consent]
"DefaultConsent"=dword:00000001

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\DontShowUI

to 1.

[WER Settings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows/bb513638%28v=vs.80%29?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396)
[Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/wer-settings)

After this is set, when your apps crash, you should see *.hdmp and *.mdmp files in:

%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\Windows\WER\

[StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3561545/how-to-terminate-a-program-when-it-crashes-which-should-just-fail-a-unit-test/3637710#3637710)

Option 1: Disable globally

Works globally on the entire user account or machine, which can be both a benefit and a drawback.

Set [HKLM|HKCU]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\DontShowUI to 1. [More info](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb513638%28VS.85%29.aspx)

Option 2: Disable for the application
Option 2a: Disable for a function:

Requires modification to the crashing program, requires Windows 7/2008 R2 (desktop apps only) or higher, described in documenation as preferred to SetErrorMode, suitable for a thread-safe library function.

Call and reset SetThreadErrorMode:

DWORD OldThreadErrorMode = 0;
SetThreadErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS,& OldThreadErrorMode);
    …
SetThreadErrorMode (z_OldThreadErrorMode, NULL);
More info: not much available?

Option 3: Specify a handler

Requires modification to the crashing program.

Use SetUnhandledExceptionFilter to set your own structured exception handler that simply exits, probably with reporting and possibly an attempt at clean-up.

Option 4: Catch as an exception

Requires modification to the crashing program. For .NET applications only.

Wrap all code into a global try/catch block. Specify the HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute and possibly also the SecurityCriticalAttribute on the method catching the exceptions. More info: Handling corrupted state exceptions

Note: this might not catch crashes caused by the Managed Debugging Assistants; if so, these also need to be disabled in the application.

Option 5: Stop the reporting process

Works globally on the entire user account, but only for a controlled duration.

Kill the Windows Error Reporting process whenever it shows up:

var werKiller = new Thread(() =>
{
    while (true)
    {
        foreach (var proc in Process.GetProcessesByName("WerFault"))
            proc.Kill();
        Thread.Sleep(3000);
    }
});
werKiller.IsBackground = true;
werKiller.Start();
This is still not completely bullet-proof though, because a console application may crash via a different error message, apparently displayed by an internal function called NtRaiseHardError:
Requires modification to the crashing program, described in documentation as best practice, unsuitable for a library function.

Call SetErrorMode: SetErrorMode(SetErrorMode(0) | SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX); (or with SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS). More info: Disabling the program crash dialog (explains the odd arrangement of calls).

### Register a DLL

If you are using Windows 7 or newer, open the folder containing the new DLL file, hold the Shift key and right-click in the folder, and select "Open command window here". The Command Prompt will open directly to that folder.
Type regsvr32 dllname.dll and press Enter. This will add the DLL file to Windows Registry.
Type regsvr32 -u dllname.dll to remove the DLL file from the Windows Registry.



## Protocol Host

Nirsoft URLProtocolView

Running `ms-taskswitcher:/` brings up task viewThe protocol host seems useful!
.

#### Getting a programs Path

Not 100% sure this works:

`|Computer|HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT|Applications|rstudio.exe|shell|open|command`

HKCR|Applications|name|shell|open|command

### Windows Search


[Windows Search Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/search/-search-3x-wds-overview)
[Legacy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/lwef/-search-2x-wds-aqsreference)

[Querying](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/search/-search-querying-interfaces-entry-page)
[Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/search/-search-reference-entry-page)
Boolean operators include AND, OR, and NOT.


When you write a query with optional criteria, you use the following syntax:

        data store or scope:value
        file kind:value
        property:value

Content = Led Zeppelin + file kind = music + length = short (1 – 5 minutes)

How to get a list of COM objects via WMI & PowerShell
Posted: October 26th, 2013 | Tags: COM, wmi | Category: PowerShell | § 
Let’s see what WMI can tell us about COM objects on the system.
Get a list of all WMI classes with the word “COM” in them (doing a case sensitive match to avoid entries like “computer”).

```ps1
1   PS> gwmi -list | ?{ $_.Name -cmatch "COM" }
2    
3      NameSpace: ROOT\cimv2
4

### Redirection

[Section copied verbatim from:](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-redirection.html)


[More Redirection](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9878007/why-doesnt-my-stderr-redirection-end-after-command-finishes-and-how-do-i-fix-i)



!!!important How-to: Redirection

  `command > filename`        Redirect command output to a file

  `command >> filename`       APPEND into a file

  `command < filename`        Type a text file and pass the text to command

  `commandA  |  commandB`     Pipe the output from commandA into commandB

  `commandA &  commandB`      Run commandA and then run commandB
  `commandA && commandB`      Run commandA, if it succeeds then run commandB
  `commandA || commandB`      Run commandA, if it fails then run commandB

  `commandA && commandB || commandC`
                              If commandA succeeds run commandB, if it fails commandC

Success and failure are based on the **Exit Code** of the command.
In most cases the Exit Code is the same as the ErrorLevel

Numeric handles:

STDIN  = 0  Keyboard input
STDOUT = 1  Text output
STDERR = 2  Error text output
UNDEFINED = 3-9

   command 2> filename       Redirect any error message into a file
   command 2>> filename      Append any error message into a file
  (command)2> filename       Redirect any CMD.exe error into a file
   command > file 2>&1       Redirect errors and output to one file
   command > fileA 2> fileB  Redirect output and errors to separate files

   command 2>&1 >filename    This will fail!

Redirect to NUL (hide errors)

   command 2> nul            Redirect error messages to NUL
   command >nul 2>&1         Redirect error and output to NUL
   command >filename 2> nul  Redirect output to file but suppress error
  (command)>filename 2> nul  Redirect output to file but suppress CMD.exe errors

Any long filenames must be surrounded in "double quotes".
A CMD error is an error raised by the command processor itself rather than the program/command.

Redirection with > or 2> will overwrite any existing file.

You can also redirect to a printer with > PRN or >LPT1
Multiple commands on one line

    In a batch file the default behaviour is to read and expand variables one line at a time, if you use & to run multiple commands on a single line, then any variable changes will not be visible until execution moves to the next line. For example:

     SET /P _cost="Enter the price: " & ECHO %_cost%

    This behaviour can be changed using SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion

Creating a new file

    Create empty files using the NUL device:

    Type NUL >EmptyFile.txt
    or
    Copy NUL EmptyFile.txt


To prevent the > and < characters from causing redirection, escape with a caret: ^> or ^<

!!!important escape with a caret: `^` e.g. ^> or ^<

Redirect multiple lines by bracketing a set of commands:

(
  Echo sample text1
  Echo sample text2
) > c:\logfile.txt 

Exit Codes

    If the filename or command is not found then redirection will set an Exit Code of 1

Unicode

    The CMD Shell can redirect ASCII/ANSI (the default) or Unicode (UCS-2 le) but not UTF-8.
    This can be selected by launching CMD /A or CMD /U

    With the default settings a UCS-2 file can be converted by redirecting it (note it's the redirection not the TYPE/MORE command that makes the encoding change)
    TYPE unicode.txt > asciifile.txt

    European characters like ABCàéÿ will usually convert correctly, but others like £¥ƒ€ will become random extended ASCII characters: œ¾Ÿ?

Pipes and CMD.exe

    When a command is piped with '| batch_command ' this will instantiate a new CMD.exe instance, in effect running:

    C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C /S /D "batch_command"

    This has several side effects:
    Any newline (CR/LF) characters in the batch_command will be turned into & operators. (see StackOverflow)
    If the batch_command includes any caret escape characters ^ they will need to be doubled up so that the escape survives into the new CMD shell.

    Starting a new CMD shell also has a small (likely unnoticable) effect on performance.

    For example, this syntax works, but would fail if the second or subsequent (piped) lines were indented with a space:
    @Echo Off
    echo abc def |^
    find "abc" |^
    find "def"> outfile.txt

    Multi-line single commands with lots of parameters, can be indented as in this example:

    Echo abc def ^
      ghi jkl ^
      mno pqr

When redirecting the output of DIR to a file, you may notice that the output file (if in the same folder) will be listed with a size of 0 bytes. The command interpreter first creates the empty destination file, then runs the DIR command and finally saves the redirected text into the file.

The maximum number of consecutive pipes is 2042

Examples:

   DIR >MyFileListing.txt
   
   DIR /o:n >"Another list of Files.txt"

   DIR C:\ >List_of_C.txt 2>errorlog.txt

   DIR C:\ >List_of_C.txt & DIR D:\ >List_of_D.txt

   ECHO y| DEL *.txt

   ECHO Some text ^<html tag^> more text

   COPY nul empty.txt

   MEM /C >>MemLog.txt

   Date /T >>MemLog.txt

   SORT < MyTextFile.txt

   SET _output=%_missing% 2>nul
   
   FIND /i "Jones" < names.txt >logfile.txt

   (TYPE logfile.txt >> newfile.txt) 2>nul

#### Symbolic Links

[Sym Links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/symbolic-links)

[Sym Links and Programs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/symbolic-link-effects-on-file-systems-functions)

A symbolic link is a file-system object that points to another file system object. The object being pointed to is called the target.

Symbolic links are transparent to users; the links appear as normal files or directories, and can be acted upon by the user or application in exactly the same manner.

Symbolic links are designed to aid in migration and application compatibility with UNIX operating systems. Microsoft has implemented its symbolic links to function just like UNIX links.

!!!example  Example of an Absolute Symbolic Link

    In this example, the original path contains a component, 'x', which is an absolute symbolic link. When 'x' is encountered, the fragment of the original path up to and including 'x' is completely replaced by the path that is pointed to by 'x'. The remainder of the path after 'x' is appended to this new path. This now becomes the modified path.

        X: "C:\alpha\beta\absLink\gamma\file"

        Link: "absLink" maps to "\\machineB\share"

        Modified Path: "\\machineB\share\gamma\file"

!!!example  Example of a Relative Symbolic Links

    In this example, the original path contains a component 'x', which is a relative symbolic link. When 'x' is encountered, 'x' is completely replaced by the new fragment pointed to by 'x'. The remainder of the path after 'x', is appended to the new path. Any dots (..) in this new path replace components that appear before the dots (..). Each set of dots replace the component preceding. If the number of dots (..) exceed the number of components, an error is returned. Otherwise, when all component replacement has finished, the final, modified path remains.

        X: C:\alpha\beta\link\gamma\file

        Link: "link" maps to "..\..\theta"

        Modified Path: "C:\alpha\beta\..\..\theta\gamma\file"

        Final Path: "C:\theta\gamma\file"

!!!Note Keep the following programming considerations in mind when working with symbolic links:
  - Symbolic links can point to a non-existent target.
  - When creating a symbolic link, the operating system does not check to see if the target exists.
  - If an application tries to open a non-existent target, ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND is returned.
  - Symbolic links are reparse points. For more information, see Determining Whether a Directory Is a Mounted Folder.
  - There is a maximum of 31 reparse points (and therefore symbolic links) allowed in a particular path.

Never knew aboput clip, and while investigating a problem yesterday I found another command I knew nothing about, the "where" command, it displays the location of a file.

where dotnet.exe
C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe

 Create a text file
copy con lazydog.txt
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Ctrl-z

cd \win*
type *.log[tab][tab][tab][tab]
cd syste[tab][tab]

Command prompt also supports drag and drop: If you want to copy the exact path to a folder or file to run the file or change the present working directory, you can simply drag and drop the file or the folder on the command prompt.
And there are more command history features available via function keys:
F1: Pastes per character last used command
F2: Pastes last used command only to a specified command character
F3: Pastes Last used command
F4: Delete command only to a specified command character
F5: Pastes last used command without cycling
F6: Pastes ^Z
F7: Provides a list of already used commands (selectable)
F8: Pastes cycleable used commands
F9: Will let you paste command from the list of recently used commands

I didn't know about clip, but then I've been using the UnxUtils collection for years and that has gclip, which does the same thing. I would probably have discovered clip by now if it wasn't for that.
Someone mentioned pushd and popd; there's a good use case for these that people may not be aware of. While you can navigate to a UNC path in File Explorer you can't cd to one on the command line, but you can use pushd to achieve the same thing. It will actually map a drive to the share with the next available drive letter, before changing to the directory. When the previous directory is popped off the stack with popd, the mapped drive is released.
I find Rob van der Woude's Scripting Pages to be a great resource for researching command line and batch language stuff. Look under Scripting Languages | Batch Files in the sidebar. There is info on a number of other scripting languages there too.

Redirecting output to txtfile always handy
Like:
dir /b | find ".exe" > findlist.txt | notepad findlist.txt
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490982.aspx

SET /A for integer arithmetic, including bitwise operators.
The FOR command, for, well, just about anything. FORFILES.EXE, for one special case thereof.
DOSKEY.EXE for command prompt macros, and also macros for any command-line application.
GETMAC.EXE for getting adapter MAC addresses on the command line.
The CMD batch language itself.
And many, many more...


@echo off
setlocal
if "%echo%" neq "" echo %echo%
pushd %~dp0
What it does:
turn off output of commands.
make changes to the environment local to the script
check if the env-var echo contains something. by doing "set echo=on" before calling the script I can switch on output of commands for debugging.
Set the current directory to the scripts directory. this is optional, but most of my scripts assume relative path (My old saying: The absolute path is the singleton of config management)


Catching errors:
dir I-do-not-exist || goto :error
goto :eof
:error
echo ERROR in %~dpnx0 %*
exit /b 1
Explanation:
"||" executes the follwing command if the first fails
skip the ":error" block
echo the file in which the error occured (full path) and all the parameters
return some error code

Something I always have to do on new machines is create a new environment variable DIRCMD and set to /ogn
setx DIRCMD /ogn
Then output from 'dir' is always sorted correctly with directories grouped at the top, can't believe it's not the default


I often use findstr to locate strings in files. A 'memory helper' for parameters is 'sin' to search for sub directories, case insensitive, display line number. Example to find foobar in txt files:
findstr /s /i /n foobar *.txt

doskey.exe can clear, set the size of, and list the command history of an executable that's attached to the current console. The implementation uses the following undocumented console APIs:
doskey /reinstall /exename=[ExeName]
  VOID ExpungeConsoleCommandHistory(LPTSTR ExeName)
doskey /listsize=[Number] /exename=[ExeName]
  BOOL SetConsoleNumberOfCommands(DWORD Number,
                                  LPTSTR ExeName)
doskey /history /exename=[ExeName]
  DWORD GetConsoleCommandHistoryLength(LPTSTR ExeName)
  DWORD GetConsoleCommandHistory(LPTSTR CommandBuffer,
                                 DWORD CommandBufferLength,
                                 LPTSTR ExeName)
I can't be the only person frustrated by how opening a new console doesn't load the command history from previous (not current) instances of console applications. The console needs a SetConsoleCommandHistory function. Please ask the team that owns the console subsystem (conhost.exe, conhostv2.dll, condrv.sys) and doskey.exe to implement something like this -- and to document these functions as public APIs. A doskey "/historyfile" option could support [ExeName] sections, like the current "/macrofile" option.
cmd.exe supports an AutoRun registry value, which would allow running doskey.exe to load command history, but it doesn't allow automatically saving history. I'd prefer that cmd.exe handled this automatically (but only for its own history) by appending to a per-user history file stored in "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Command Processor\history.txt", which reflects the location of its registry key, "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor".



Sorry, one more favorite of mine
start .
Open a File Explorer for the current directory. Because sometimes dir doesn't cut it.


dir /s | more
for pausing output per page


dir /a,
Hidden dir parameter - shows all files (hidden, system, etc) without have to specify the full list of things to unhide. (note that is a comma after the "/a")


"mklink" is a good use of "cmd". I prefer symbolic links to shortcuts. I haven't seen a way to make symbolic links in the file manager.



Try this on command line on NTFS drive:
echo hidden > test.txt:hidden
echo hidden2 >> test.txt:hidden
do a dir test.txt , what's the file size?
do a type test.txt or use notepad to edit , it's empty
do a more < test.txt:hidden
you see what you have echo and pipe and append into the test.txt section hidden ;-)


hostname
whoami


Don't forget pushd and popd.
'Pushd' changes directory to the parameter and remembers the current directory on a stack. It's a little better than 'cd' because you can also change folders and drive letters in one command.
'Popd' pops the directory off the stack and changes to it -- including changing drive letters.
So with pushd and popd you can really drill in and then pop back. I use a DOSKEY macrofile that makes 'cd' a macro for pushd and '.' a macro for popd. This turns the '.' key into a back button.



'Call' for subroutines
To execute a set of custom commands based on command line arguments
1. Parse/validate command line arguments
2. Use ECHO to write .bat file to execute the sequence of commands
3. Call that batch file
This provides equivalent function call functionality to bash.
Current command set:
- The built in dos batch commands
- gnuwin32 - most of the basic unix commands
- sysinternals suite
- image processing
- optipng - compress and fix badly formatted png files
- imagej - open dicom and lots of basic image formats, image processing, opens source
- xpdf - extract text from pdf, render pdf pages to 300 or higher dpi image files, extrac images from pdf, split pdf into individual pages, concatenate pdf files into a single pdf, ...
- jpegtran - optimize jpeg files, drop partial blocks from edge of file
- imagemagick
- gnuwin32's tiff2pdf convert a multipage tiff file to a single pdf
- media
- mplayer
- videolan
- audio
- lame
That's let me watch/convert from most video and audio formats, convert/extract/build pdf files, ...
If VS would only add one thing.....tell the actual DLL that was not found when it reports a DLL or one of its dependencies could not be loaded........................
The OS has the information since it could not find/load the DLL and should have a way to report it back to VS in debug mode.....

### FOR Command

Runs a specified command for each file in a set of files.

`FOR %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters]`

  `%variable`  Specifies a single letter replaceable parameter.
  `(set)`      Specifies a set of one or more files.  Wildcards may be used.
  `command`    Specifies the command to carry out for each file.
  `command-parameters` Specifies parameters or switches for the specified command.

To use the FOR command in a batch program, specify %%variable instead
of %variable.  Variable names are case sensitive, so %i is different
from %I.

If Command Extensions are enabled, the following additional
forms of the FOR command are supported:

`FOR /D %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters]`

    If set contains wildcards, then specifies to match against directory
    names instead of file names.

`FOR /R [[drive:]path] %variable IN (set) DO command [command-parameters]`

    Walks the directory tree rooted at [drive:]path, executing the FOR
    statement in each directory of the tree.  If no directory
    specification is specified after /R then the current directory is
    assumed.  If set is just a single period (.) character then it
    will just enumerate the directory tree.

      FOR /L %variable IN (start,step,end) DO command [command-parameters]

The set is a sequence of numbers from start to end, by step amount.
So (1,1,5) would generate the sequence 1 2 3 4 5 and (5,-1,1) would  generate the sequence (5 4 3 2 1)

    FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN (file-set) DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN ("string") DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN ('command') DO command [command-parameters]

or, if usebackq option present:

    FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN (file-set) DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN ('string') DO command [command-parameters]
    FOR /F ["options"] %variable IN (`command`) DO command [command-parameters]

file-set is one or more file names.  Each file is opened, read and processed before going on to the next file in file-set. 

Processing consists of reading in the file, breaking it up into individual lines of text and then parsing each line into zero or more tokens.  The body of the for loop is then called with the variable value(s) set to the found token string(s).  By default, `/F` passes the first blank separated token from each line of each file. Blank lines are skipped.  You can override the default parsing behavior by specifying the optional "options" parameter.  This is a quoted string which contains one or more keywords to specify different parsing options.  

The keywords are:

        `eol=c`           - specifies an end of line comment character (just one)
        `skip=n`          - specifies the number of lines to skip at the beginning of the file.
        `delims=xxx `     - specifies a delimiter set.  This replaces the default delimiter set of space and tab.
        `tokens=x,y,m-n`  - specifies which tokens from each line are to be passed to the for body for each iteration.
        This will cause additional variable names to be allocated.  The m-n form is a range, specifying the mth through the nth tokens.  If the last character in the tokens= string is an asterisk, then an additional variable is allocated and receives the remaining text on the line after the last token parsed.
        `usebackq` - specifies that the new semantics are in force, where a back quoted string is executed as a command and a single quoted string is a
                          literal string command and allows the use of
                          double quotes to quote file names in
                          file-set.

    Some examples might help:

FOR /F "eol=; tokens=2,3* delims=, " %i in (myfile.txt) do @echo %i %j %k

    would parse each line in myfile.txt, ignoring lines that begin with
    a semicolon, passing the 2nd and 3rd token from each line to the for
    body, with tokens delimited by commas and/or spaces.  Notice the for
    body statements reference %i to get the 2nd token, %j to get the
    3rd token, and %k to get all remaining tokens after the 3rd.  For
    file names that contain spaces, you need to quote the filenames with
    double quotes.  In order to use double quotes in this manner, you also
    need to use the usebackq option, otherwise the double quotes will be
    interpreted as defining a literal string to parse.

    %i is explicitly declared in the for statement and the %j and %k
    are implicitly declared via the tokens= option.  You can specify up
    to 26 tokens via the tokens= line, provided it does not cause an
    attempt to declare a variable higher than the letter 'z' or 'Z'.
    Remember, FOR variables are single-letter, case sensitive, global,
    and you can't have more than 52 total active at any one time.

    You can also use the FOR /F parsing logic on an immediate string, by
    making the file-set between the parenthesis a quoted string,
    using single quote characters.  It will be treated as a single line
    of input from a file and parsed.

    Finally, you can use the FOR /F command to parse the output of a
    command.  You do this by making the file-set between the
    parenthesis a back quoted string.  It will be treated as a command
    line, which is passed to a child CMD.EXE and the output is captured
    into memory and parsed as if it was a file.  So the following
    example:

      FOR /F "usebackq delims==" %i IN (`set`) DO @echo %i

    would enumerate the environment variable names in the current
    environment.

In addition, substitution of FOR variable references has been enhanced.
You can now use the following optional syntax:

    %~I         - expands %I removing any surrounding quotes (")
    %~fI        - expands %I to a fully qualified path name
    %~dI        - expands %I to a drive letter only
    %~pI        - expands %I to a path only
    %~nI        - expands %I to a file name only
    %~xI        - expands %I to a file extension only
    %~sI        - expanded path contains short names only
    %~aI        - expands %I to file attributes of file
    %~tI        - expands %I to date/time of file
    %~zI        - expands %I to size of file
    %~$PATH:I   - searches the directories listed in the PATH
                   environment variable and expands %I to the
                   fully qualified name of the first one found.
                   If the environment variable name is not
                   defined or the file is not found by the
                   search, then this modifier expands to the
                   empty string

The modifiers can be combined to get compound results:

    %~dpI       - expands %I to a drive letter and path only
    %~nxI       - expands %I to a file name and extension only
    %~fsI       - expands %I to a full path name with short names only
    %~dp$PATH:I - searches the directories listed in the PATH
                   environment variable for %I and expands to the
                   drive letter and path of the first one found.
    %~ftzaI     - expands %I to a DIR like output line

In the above examples %I and PATH can be replaced by other valid
values.  The %~ syntax is terminated by a valid FOR variable name.
Picking upper case variable names like %I makes it more readable and
avoids confusion with the modifiers, which are not case sensitive.

### MKLINK

        Creates a symbolic link.

        MKLINK [[/D] | [/H] | [/J]] Link Target

                /D      Creates a directory symbolic link.  Default is a file
                        symbolic link.
                /H      Creates a hard link instead of a symbolic link.
                /J      Creates a Directory Junction.
                Link    Specifies the new symbolic link name.
                Target  Specifies the path (relative or absolute) that the new link
                        refers to.

[Junctions and Hardlinks]
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/hard-links-and-junctions)

[Symbolic Links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/creating-symbolic-links)


Arg 1 is the shortcut name, what you will click on to go where you want.

3 Options

[[none]] No flags- This creates a symbolic link between **files**  It creates a new pseudofile that occcrs elsewhere

[[D]] -more like a shortcut, but not a file.  Opening Folder A drops you in Folder B. This is the directory version of the 'default' option.

[[H]]   A hard link refers to a **file** not a directory

[[J]] - this is complicated.  The destination apparently cannot exist yet.  So I created `mklink /K folA folB`  A shortcut named `folA`.  Then I must create folder B.  In the expected spot.  Now when I open Folder B I am in Folder B.  And when I open Folder A I am in folder A.  But Anything in one appears in the other.

        The shortcut can't already exist, but the destination can.

### FSUTIL

[A reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fsutil)

**You must be logged on as an administrator** or a member of the Administrators group to use Fsutil. The Fsutil command is quite powerful and should be used only by advanced users who have a thorough knowledge of Windows operating systems.

You **have to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux before you can run Fsutil.** Run the following command as Administrator in PowerShell to enable this optional feature:

`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`

You'll be prompted to restart your computer once it's installed. After your computer restarts, you'll be able to run Fsutil as an administrator

#### Subcommand & Description

- `Fsutil 8dot3name` - Queries or changes the settings for short name behavior on the system, for example, generates 8.3 character-length file names. Removes short names for all files within a directory. Scans a directory and identifies registry keys that might be impacted if short names were stripped from the files in the directory.

- `Fsutil behavior` - Queries or sets volume behavior.

- `Fsutil dirty` - Queries whether the volume's dirty bit is set or sets a volume's dirty bit. When a volume's dirty bit is set, autochk automatically checks the volume for errors the next time the computer is restarted.

- `Fsutil file` - Finds a file by user name (if Disk Quotas are enabled), queries allocated ranges for a file, sets a file's short name, sets a file's valid data length, sets zero data for a file, creates a new file of a specified size, finds a file ID if given the name, or finds a file link name for a specified file ID.

- `Fsutil fsinfo` - Lists all drives and queries the drive type, volume information, NTFS-specific volume information, or file system statistics.

- `Fsutil hardlink` - Lists hard links for a file, or creates a hard link (a directory entry for a file). Every file can be considered to have at least one hard link. On NTFS volumes, each file can have multiple hard links, so a single file can appear in many directories (or even in the same directory, with different names). Because all of the links reference the same file, programs can open any of the links and modify the file. A file is deleted from the file system only after all links to it are deleted. After you create a hard link, programs can use it like any other file name.

- `Fsutil objectid` - Manages object identifiers, which are used by the Windows operating system to track objects such as files and directories.

- `Fsutil quota` - Manages disk quotas on NTFS volumes to provide more precise control of network-based storage. Disk quotas are implemented on a per-volume basis and enable both hard- and soft-storage limits to be implemented on a per-user basis.

- `Fsutil repair` - Queries or sets the self-healing state of the volume. Self-healing NTFS attempts to correct corruptions of the NTFS file system online without requiring Chkdsk.exe to be run. Includes initiating on-disk verification and waiting for repair completion.

- `Fsutil reparsepoint` - Queries or deletes reparse points (NTFS file system objects that have a definable attribute containing user-controlled data). Reparse points are used to extend functionality in the input/output (I/O) subsystem. They are used for directory junction points and volume mount points. They are also used by file system filter drivers to mark certain files as special to that driver.

- `Fsutil resource` - Creates a Secondary Transactional Resource Manager, starts or stops a Transactional Resource Manager, displays information about a Transactional Resource Manager or modifies its behavior.

- `Fsutil sparse` - Manages sparse files. A sparse file is a file with one or more regions of unallocated data in it. A program will see these unallocated regions as containing bytes with the value zero, but no disk space is used to represent these zeros. All meaningful or nonzero data is allocated, whereas all non-meaningful data (large strings of data composed of zeros) is not allocated. When a sparse file is read, allocated data is returned as stored and unallocated data is returned as zeros (by default in accordance with the C2 security requirement specification). Sparse file support allows data to be deallocated from anywhere in the file.

- `Fsutil tiering` - Enables management of storage tier functions, such as setting and disabling flags and listing of tiers.

- `Fsutil transaction` - Commits a specified transaction, rolls back a specified transaction, or displays info about the transaction.


- `Fsutil usn` - Manages the update sequence number (USN) change journal, which provides a persistent log of all changes made to files on the volume.

- `Fsutil volume` - Manages a volume. Dismounts a volume, queries to see how much free space is available on a disk, or finds a file that is using a specified cluster.

- `Fsutil wim` - Provides functions to discover and manage WIM-backed files.

### clip

PIPE COMMAND OUTPUT TO THE CLIPBOARD
In Vista they added clip.exe. It captures any standard input and puts in the clipboard.

That means you can

```bat
dir /s | clip
ver | clip
ipconfig /all | clip
```

### type

type followed by the filename prints the contents of the file. Use the pipe (|) and clip to copy to the clipboard. Works in the same way cat does in PowerShell.

type somefile.txt | clip


### F7

F7 GIVES YOU A GRAPHICAL (TEXT) HISTORY

If you have already typed a few commands, you can press F7 to get an ANSI popup with a list of commands you've typed. 4DOS anyone?

F11 or "ALT-ENTER" in the command prompt (any prompt, cmd, powershell, or bash) will make it full screen. I like to put my command prompt on another virtual desktop and then use CTRL-WIN-ARROWS to move between them.


### Env access

You can acess env sort of like Powershell

`cd $env:LocalAppData`
 only works in powershell.  So not really new...
 


###  Clip - Clipboard CMD

Pipe commands to and from then clipboard

```bat
cd | clip
dir /b /s | clip
mode con rate=32 delay=1
echo AT&F&C1&D2M1L3S11=33 > COM
```


### mpcmdrun.exe (Windows Defen

 [^Restore]:  [-ListAll \| [[-Name ] [-All] \| [-FilePath ]] [-Path ]]

[^Trace]: [-Grouping #] [-Level #]

[^SignatureUpdate]: [-UNC \| -MMPC]
To run, use:


[^Remove]: RemoveDefinitions
  [-All] Restores the installed Security intelligence to a previous backup copy or to the original default set
 [-DynamicSignatures] Removes only the dynamically downloaded Security intelligence
 [-Engine]  Restores the previous installed engine
`"%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -scan -scantype 3 -File <Path> -DisableRemediation`

Scantype 3 means a specific directory/file. File gives the file, and disabling remediation prevents any outcomes except to terminal (deleting, logging, attempting clean.)

### RunDll and its command

Can be run in AHK - from Help on RUn

If Target contains any commas, they must be escaped as shown three times in the following example:

        Run rundll32.exe shell32.dll`,Control_RunDLL desk.cpl`,`, 3  ; Opens Control Panel > Display Properties > Settings

When running a program via ComSpec (cmd.exe) -- perhaps because you need to redirect the program's input or output -- if the path or name of the executable contains spaces, the entire string should be enclosed in an outer pair of quotes. In the following example, the outer quotes are shown in red and all the inner quotes are shown in black:

        Run %ComSpec% /c ""C:\My Utility.exe" "param 1" "second param" >"C:\My File.txt""

If Target cannot be launched, an error window is displayed and the current thread is exited, unless the string UseErrorLevel is included in the third parameter or the error is caught by a Try/Catch statement.

Performance may be slightly improved if Target is an exact path, e.g. Run, C:\Windows\Notepad.exe "C:\My Documents\Test.txt" rather than Run, C:\My Documents\Test.txt.

Special CLSID folders may be opened via Run. For example:

        Run ::{20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d}  ; Opens the "My Computer" folder.
        Run ::{645ff040-5081-101b-9f08-00aa002f954e}  ; Opens the Recycle Bin.

### Turn off the monitors

```powershell
#PS
Add-Type '[DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern int SendMessage(int hWnd, int hMsg, int wParam, int lParam);' -Name a -Pas)::SendMessage(-1,0x0112,0xF170,2)
```

powershell (Add-Type '[DllImport(\"user32.dll\")]^public static extern int SendMessage(int hWnd, int hMsg, int wParam, int lParam);' -Name a -Pas)::SendMessage(-1,0x0112,0xF170,2)
```

Seems to leave a process running though. It doesn't end on its own. May be worth investigating.

### SFC

        Computername      A unique name that identifies a computer on
                        the local-area network.

        Devicename        The name by which Windows identifies a disk resource
                        or printer. A disk resource is identified by a drive
                        letter followed by a colon (for example, D:). A
                        printer is identified by a port name followed by a colon
                        (for example, LPT1:).

        Workgroup         A group of computers on the network. Each workgroup
                        has a unique name.

        Localgroup        A group of names in a Workgroup that are granted the
                        same rights.

        Domain            A group of Windows Servers, Windows Workstations
                        and other computers on the network. A
                        domain has a unique name. Usually, you must log on in
                        a domain to gain access to the network. Domains are
                        created and managed with Windows Server.

        Global group      A group of names in a domain that are granted the
                        same rights.

        Filename          The name of a file. Under the file allocation table
                        (FAT) file system, a filename can have as many as eight
                        characters, followed by a period (.) and an extension of
                        as many as three characters. Under NTFS and HPFS, a
                        filename can have as many as 254 characters.

        Network path      A description of the location of a shared resource,
                        consisting of a computer's computername followed by
                        the sharename of the resource. The computername
                        is preceded by two backslashes, and the sharename is
                        preceded by one backslash (for example,
                        \\SERVER1\RESOURCE).

        Path              The location of a directory. A path can consist of a
                        devicename and one or more directory names. A
                        backslash (\) precedes each directory name (for example,
                        C:\CUSTOMER\CORP\ACCT).

        Pathname          A path and a filename. The filename is preceded by a
                        backslash (\) (for example, C:\CUSTOMER\CORP\REPORT.DOC).

        Sharename         A name that identifies a shared resource on a computer. A
                        sharename is used with the computer's computername to form
                        a network path (as in \\SERVER\RESOURCE).

        Username          The name a person supplies when logging on at
                        a computer.

        SYNTAX
        The following conventions are used to indicate command syntax:

        -  Capital letters represent words that must be typed as shown. Lower-
        case letters represent names of items that may vary, such as filenames.

        -  The [ and ] characters surround optional items that can be supplied
        with the command.

        -  The { and } characters surround lists of items. You must supply one
        of the items with the command.

        -  The | character separates items in a list. Only one of the items can
        be supplied with the command.

        For example, in the following syntax, you must type NET COMMAND and
        either SWITCH1 or SWITCH2. Supplying a name is optional.
            NET COMMAND [name] {SWITCH1 | SWITCH2}

        -  The [...] characters mean you can repeat the previous item.
        Separate items with spaces.

        -  The [,...] characters mean you can repeat the previous item, but
        you must separate items with commas or semicolons, not spaces.

        -  When typed at the command prompt, service names of two words or
        more must be enclosed in quotation marks. For example,
        NET START "COMPUTER BROWSER" starts the computer browser service.


### Where 

Useful Command Line Searching

[Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/where_1)



Displays the location of files that match the given search pattern.

      where [/r <Dir>] [/q] [/f] [/t] [$<ENV>:|<Path>:]<Pattern>[ ...]

Parameters
Parameter 	Description
- `/r <Dir> ` - Indicates a recursive search, starting with the specified directory.
- `/q ` - Returns an exit code (0 for success, 1 for failure) without displaying the list of matched files.
- `/f ` - Displays the results of the where command in quotation marks.
- `/t ` - Displays the file size and the last modified date and time of each matched file.
- `[$<ENV>:|<Path>:]<Pattern>[ ...] ` - Specifies the search pattern for the files to match. At least one pattern is required, and the pattern can include wildcard characters (* and ?). By default, where searches the current directory and the paths that are specified in the PATH environment variable. You can specify a different path to search by using the format $ENV:Pattern (where ENV is an existing environment variable containing one or more paths) or by using the format Path:Pattern (where Path is the directory path you want to search). These optional formats should not be used with the /r command-line option.
- `/? ` - Displays help at the command prompt.


Remarks

    If you do not specify a file name extension, the extensions listed in the PATHEXT environment variable are appended to the pattern by default.
    Where can run recursive searches, display file information such as date or size, and accept environment variables in place of paths on local computers.

Examples

To find all files named Test in drive C of the current computer and its subdirectories, type:

where /r c:\ test

To list all files in the Public directory, type:

where $public:*.*

To find all files named Notepad in drive C of the remote computer, Computer1, and its subdirectories, type:

where /r \\computer1\c notepad.*



### FType 

See what is used to open specific programs. 


!!!example A working Example:
    This is really specific, so you can use assoc like this `assoc .docx`


    ```cmd
    >assoc .docx | clip 
    .docx=Word.Document.12


    >FType Word.Document.12  |clip
    Word.Document.12="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE" /n "%1" /o "%u"
    ```

    This gives you the precise command string that is executed when opening a *docx* file.



[Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/ftype)
Syntax

Displays or modifies file types that are used in file name extension associations. If used without an assignment operator (=), this command displays the current open command string for the specified file type. If used without parameters, this command displays the file types that have open command strings defined.

ftype [<filetype>[=[<opencommandstring>]]]

- `#### Parameter` - Description

- `<filetype>` - Specifies the file type to display or change.
- `<opencommandstring>` - Specifies the open command string to use when opening files of the specified file type.
- `/?` - Displays help at the command prompt.


#### Has some weird parameter passing stuff

- `Variable ` - Replacement value
- `%0 or %1 ` - Gets substituted with the file name being launched through the association.
- `%* ` - Gets all of the parameters.
- `%2, %3, ... ` - Gets the first parameter (%2), the second parameter (%3), and so on.
- `%~<n> ` - Gets all of the remaining parameters starting with the nth parameter, where n can be any number from 2 to 9.

#### Examples

To display the current file types that have open command strings defined, type:

`ftype`

To display the current open command string for the txtfile file type, type:

`ftype txtfile`

This command produces output similar to the following:

`txtfile=%SystemRoot%\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE %1`

To delete the open command string for a file type called example, type:

`ftype example=`

To associate the .pl file name extension with the PerlScript file type and enable the PerlScript file type to run PERL.EXE, type the following commands:

      assoc .pl=PerlScript
      ftype PerlScript=perl.exe %1 %*

To eliminate the need to type the .pl file name extension when invoking a Perl script, type:

        set PATHEXT=.pl;%PATHEXT%


### Assoc 


Displays or modifies file name extension associations. If used without parameters, assoc displays a list of all the current file name extension associations.

Syntax `assoc [<.ext>[=[<filetype>]]]`

- `Parameter ` - Description
- `<.ext>` - Specifies the file name extension.
- `<filetype>` Specifies the file type to associate with the specified file name extension.
- `/?` - Displays help at the command prompt.
Remarks

    To remove the file type association for a file name extension, add a white space after the equal sign by pressing the SPACEBAR.

    To view current file types that have open command strings defined, use the ftype command.

    To redirect the output of assoc to a text file, use the > redirection operator.

Examples

To view the current file type association for the file name extension .txt, type:

`assoc .txt`

To remove the file type association for the file name extension .bak, type:

`assoc .bak=`

!!! Note Note: Make sure you add a space after the equal sign.

To view the output of assoc one screen at a time, type:

`assoc | more`

To send the output of assoc to the file assoc.txt, type:

`assoc>assoc.txt`


### Attrib

Sets and changes file attributes.


`attrib -a example.doc`

The above command will unset archive attribute for the file example.doc

[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/attrib)

- R - **ReadOnly**
- A - **Archive file attribute.**
- S - System file attribute.
- H - Hidden file attribute.
- O - *Offline attribute.*
- I - **Not content indexed file attribute.**
- X - *No scrub file attribute.*
- V - *Integrity attribute.*
- P - *Pinned attribute.*
- U - *Unpinned attribute.*
- B - *SMR Blob attribute.*

Parameter	Description
- `{+|-}r ` - Sets (+) or clears (-) the Read-only file attribute.
- `{+\|-}a ` - Sets (+) or clears (-) the Archive file attribute. This attribute set marks files that have changed since the last time they were backed up. Note that the xcopy command uses archive attributes.
- `{+\|-}s ` - Sets (+) or clears (-) the System file attribute. If a file uses this attribute set, you must clear the attribute before you can change any other attributes for the file.
- `{+\|-}h ` - Sets (+) or clears (-) the Hidden file attribute. If a file uses this attribute set, you must clear the attribute before you can change any other attributes for the file.
- `{+\|-}i ` - Sets (+) or clears (-) the Not Content Indexed file attribute.
- `[<drive>:][<path>][<filename>] ` - Specifies the location and name of the directory, file, or group of files for which you want to display or change attributes.

You can use the ? and * wildcard characters in the filename parameter to display or change the attributes for a group of files.
- `/s ` - Applies attrib and any command-line options to matching files in the current directory and all of its subdirectories.
- `/d ` - Applies attrib and any command-line options to directories.
- `/l ` - Applies attrib and any command-line options to the Symbolic Link, rather than the target of the Symbolic Link.
- `/? ` - Displays help at the command prompt.

A few useful aspects:

Navigate to a root dir, and run `ATTRIB /S /D -A` -  this clears the archive attribute.  Any file that changes from that point on will have it set.  Then you can run backup only files with `+A` attribute.

I am interesting in checking out if the `-I` flag might help my computer or laptop from wasting time.

Read Only and Hidden are visible in Properties.  Archive and Index are under advanced.  I am not sure what the remaining attributes do or where to find them.  Interestingly, the italicized items dont even appear in documentation.

#### Groups of files

[Source](https://www.windows-commandline.com/clear-archive-attribute-from-command/)
There is no direct command for setting/unsetting attributes for a group of files. Attrib command works on one file at a time. You can use the following batch file command though.

for /F %i in (‘dir /s /b ‘) do attrib -A %i
This command will unset archive attributes for all the files in the current directory and in the subdirectories.

To do this for a directory the command would be:
for /F %i in (‘dir /s /b directory_path ‘) do attrib -A %i

```batch
for /F %i in (‘dir /s /b ‘) do attrib -A %i
REM This command will unset archive attributes for all the files in the current directory and in the subdirectories.

REM To do this for a directory the command would be:
for /F %i in (‘dir /s /b directory_path ‘) do attrib -A %i
```

On the other hand,  `attrib` command accepts wild characters and can process files in bulk. The syntax for bulk processing is given below [Source](https://www.windows-commandline.com/attrib-command/)



```batch

attrib +[R/H/S/A]  *


REM To set attribute for files of certain type/extension

attrib +[R/H/S/A] *.ext


REM To set attribute for all files in current directory

attrib +[R/H/S/A]


REM Example: Set hidden attribute on all PDF files in the current directory

attrib +H *.pdf
```

note- unsure if in the above example `+[R/H/S/A]` is valid syntax.  I think they mean one of those.


### Typeperf

Seems like a benchmarking bit of software?  Unknown previously *(to me)*

      Note:
        Counter is the full name of a performance counter in
        "\\<Computer>\<Object>(<Instance>)\<Counter>" format,
        such as "\\Server1\Processor(0)\% User Time".

      Examples:
        typeperf "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time"
        typeperf -cf counters.txt -si 5 -sc 50 -f TSV -o domain2.tsv
        typeperf -qx PhysicalDisk -o counters.txt

To change the language ID used by the command line to English (locale ID 409), type:

wmic /locale:ms_409


### prompt 

Prompt adds some interesting changes to the prompt, though they tend not to stick.

Changes the Cmd.exe command prompt, including displaying any text you want, such as the name of the current directory, the time and date, or the Microsoft Windows version number. If used without parameters, this command resets the command prompt to the default setting, which is the current drive letter and directory followed by the greater than symbol (>).

Syntax:  `prompt [<text>]`
- `<text> ` - Specifies the text and information that you want to include in the command prompt.
- `/? ` - Displays help at the command prompt.

The character combinations you can include instead of, or in addition to, one or more character strings in the text parameter:
- `    $q ` - = (Equal sign)
- `    $$ ` - $ (Dollar sign)
- `    $t ` - Current time
- `    $d ` - Current date
- `    $p ` - Current drive and path
- `    $v ` - Windows version number
- `    $n ` - Current drive
- `    $g ` - > (Greater than sign)
- `    $l ` - < (Less than sign)
- `    $b ` - | (Pipe symbol)
- `    $_ ` - ENTER-LINEFEED
- `    $e ` - ANSI escape code (code 27)
- `    $h ` - Backspace (to delete a character that has been written to the command line)
- `    $a ` - & (Ampersand)
- `    $c ` - ( (Left parenthesis)
- `    $f ` - ) (Right parenthesis)
- `    $s ` - Space

    When command extensions are enabled the prompt command supports the following formatting characters:
    Table 3

- `    $+ ` - Zero or more plus sign (+) characters, depending on the depth of the pushd directory stack (one character for each level pushed).
- `    $m ` - The remote name associated with the current drive letter or the empty string if current drive is not a network drive.

    If you include the $p character in the text parameter, your disk is read after you enter each command (to determine the current drive and path). This can take extra time, especially for floppy disk drives.

Examples

To set a two-line command prompt with the current time and date on the first line and the greater than sign on the next line, type:

prompt $d$s$s$t$_$g

The prompt is changed as follows, where the date and time are current:

Fri 06/01/2007  13:53:28.91

To set the command prompt to display as an arrow (-->), type:

prompt --$g

To manually change the command prompt to the default setting (the current drive and path followed by the greater than sign), type:

prompt $p$g
### rem


#### in a batch file:  

[src](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/rem_1)


Records comments (remarks) in a batch file or CONFIG.SYS. If no comment is specified, rem adds vertical spacing.

`rem [<Comment>]`
- `<Comment> ` - Specifies a string of characters to include as a comment.
- `/? ` - Displays help at the command prompt.

    The rem command does not display comments on the screen. You must use the echo on command in your batch or CONFIG.SYS file to display comments on the screen.
    You cannot use a redirection character (< or >) or pipe (|) in a batch file comment.
    Although you can use rem without a comment to add vertical spacing to a batch file, you can also use blank lines. Blank lines are ignored when a batch program is processed.

- Examples

To shows a batch file that uses remarks for comments and for vertical spacing:

        @echo off
        rem  This batch program formats and checks new disks.
        rem  It is named Checknew.bat.
        rem
        rem echo Insert new disk in Drive B.
        pause
        format b: /v chkdsk b:

To include an explanatory comment before the prompt command in your CONFIG.SYS file, add the following lines to CONFIG.SYS:

        rem Set prompt to indicate current directory
        prompt $p$g

#### rem - in a script: 

Provides a way to add comments to a script.

- Examples

In this example script, rem is used to provide a comment about what the script does:

        rem The commands in this script set up 3 drives.
        rem The first drive is a primary partition and is
        rem assigned the letter D. The second and third drives
        rem are logical partitions, and are assigned letters
        rem E and F.
        create partition primary size=2048
        assign d:
        create partition extended
        create partition logical size=2048
        assign e:
        create partition logical
        assign f:

### replace

[ref](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/replace)


Replaces files. If used with the /a option, replace adds new files to a directory instead of replacing existing files.

`replace [<Drive1>:][<Path1>]<FileName> [<Drive2>:][<Path2>] [/a] [/p] [/r] [/w]`
`replace [<Drive1>:][<Path1>]<FileName> [<Drive2>:][<Path2>] [/p] [/r] [/s] [/w] [/u]`

- `[<Drive1>:][<Path1>]<FileName>` - Specifies the location and name of the source file or set of files. FileName is required, and can include wildcard characters (* and ?).
- `[<Drive2>:][<Path2>]` - Specifies the location of the destination file. You cannot specify a file name for files you replace. If you do not specify a drive or path, replace uses the current drive and directory as the destination.
- `/a` - Adds new files to the destination directory instead of replacing existing files. You cannot use this command-line option with the /s or /u command-line option.
- `/p` - Prompts you for confirmation before replacing a destination file or adding a source file.
- `/r` - Replaces Read-only and unprotected files. If you attempt to replace a Read-only file, but you do not specify /r, an error results and stops the replacement operation.
- `/w` - Waits for you to insert a disk before the search for source files begins. If you do not specify /w, replace begins replacing or adding files immediately after you press ENTER.
- `/s` - Searches all subdirectories in the destination directory and replaces matching files. You cannot use /s with the /a command-line option. The replace command does not search subdirectories that are specified in Path1.
- `/u` - Replaces only those files on the destination directory that are older than those in the source directory. You cannot use /u with the /a command-line option.
- `/?` - Displays help at the command prompt.


As replace adds or replaces files, the file names are displayed on the screen. After replace is finished, a summary line is displayed in one of the following formats:

          nnn files added
          nnn files replaced
          no file added
          no file replaced

If you are using floppy disks and you need to switch disks during the replace operation, you can specify the /w command-line option so that replace will wait for you to switch the disks.
  
You cannot use replace to update hidden files or system files.


The following table shows each exit code and a brief description of its meaning:

          |Exit code|Description| |---------|-----------| |0|The replace command successfully replaced or added the files.| |1|The replace command encountered an incorrect version of MS-DOS.| |2|The replace command could not find the source files.| |3|The replace command could not find the source or destination path.| |5|The user does not have access to the files that you want to replace.| |8|There is insufficient system memory to carry out the command.| |11|The user used the wrong syntax on the command line.|


You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the if command line in a batch program to process exit codes that are returned by replace.


To update all the versions of a file named Phones.cli (which appear in multiple directories on drive C), with the latest version of the Phones.cli file from a floppy disk in drive A, type:

      replace a:\phones.cli c:\ /s

## Changing Computer State

### Locking a Computer-  Calling User32.dll functions

The only way to lock a computer directly with the standard available tools is to call the `LockWorkstation()` function in `user32.dll`:

        rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation


This command immediately locks the workstation. It uses `rundll32.exe`, which runs Windows DLLs (and saves their libraries for repeated use) to run `user32.dll`, a library of Windows management functions.

When you lock a workstation while Fast User Switching is enabled, such as on Windows XP, the computer displays the user logon screen rather than starting the current user's screensaver.

To shut down particular sessions on a Terminal Server, use the `tsshutdn.exe` command-line tool.

### Logging Off the Current Session

You can use several different techniques to log off of a session on the local system. The simplest way is to use the **Remote Desktop/Terminal Services** command-line tool, `logoff.exe` (For details, at the Windows PowerShell prompt, type logoff /?). To log off the current active session, type logoff with no arguments.

You can also use the shutdown.exe tool with its logoff option:

        shutdown.exe -l
        shutdown /t=0

A third option is to use WMI. The **Win32_OperatingSystem** class has a **Win32Shutdown method**. Invoking the method with the **0** flag initiates logoff:

		(Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName .).Win32Shutdown(0)

For more information, and to find other features of the Win32Shutdown method, see "Win32Shutdown Method of the Win32_OperatingSystem Class" in MSDN.

### Shutting Down or Restarting a Computer

Shutting down and restarting computers are generally the same types of task. Tools that shut down a computer will generally restart it as well—and vice versa. There are two straightforward options for restarting a computer from Windows PowerShell. Use either `Tsshutdn.exe` or `Shutdown.exe` with appropriate arguments. You can get detailed usage information from `tsshutdn.exe /?` or `shutdown.exe /?`.


#### shutdown.exe

!!!note note: It also gives information on the counts and reasons

        Usage: shutdown.exe [/i | /l | /s | /sg | /r | /g | /a | /p | /h | /e | /o] [/hybrid] [/soft] [/fw] [/f]
            [/m \\computer][/t xxx][/d [p|u:]xx:yy [/c "comment"]]

            No args    Display help. This is the same as typing /?.
            /?         Display help. This is the same as not typing any options.
            /i         Display the graphical user interface (GUI).
                    This must be the first option.
            /l         Log off. This cannot be used with /m or /d options.
            /s         Shutdown the computer.
            /sg        Shutdown the computer. On the next boot,
                    restart any registered applications.
            /r         Full shutdown and restart the computer.
            /g         Full shutdown and restart the computer. After the system is
                    rebooted, restart any registered applications.
            /a         Abort a system shutdown.
                    This can only be used during the time-out period.
                    Combine with /fw to clear any pending boots to firmware.
            /p         Turn off the local computer with no time-out or warning.
                    Can be used with /d and /f options.
            /h         Hibernate the local computer.
                    Can be used with the /f option.
            /hybrid    Performs a shutdown of the computer and prepares it for fast startup.
                    Must be used with /s option.
            /fw        Combine with a shutdown option to cause the next boot to go to the
                    firmware user interface.
            /e         Document the reason for an unexpected shutdown of a computer.
            /o         Go to the advanced boot options menu and restart the computer.
                    Must be used with /r option.
            /m \\computer Specify the target computer.
            /t xxx     Set the time-out period before shutdown to xxx seconds.
                    The valid range is 0-315360000 (10 years), with a default of 30.
                    If the timeout period is greater than 0, the /f parameter is
                    implied.
            /c "comment" Comment on the reason for the restart or shutdown.
                    Maximum of 512 characters allowed.
            /f         Force running applications to close without forewarning users.
                    The /f parameter is implied when a value greater than 0 is
                    specified for the /t parameter.
            /d [p|u:]xx:yy  Provide the reason for the restart or shutdown.
                    p indicates that the restart or shutdown is planned.
                    u indicates that the reason is user defined.
                    If neither p nor u is specified the restart or shutdown is
                    unplanned.
                    xx is the major reason number (positive integer less than 256).
                    yy is the minor reason number (positive integer less than 65536).

!!!warning `tsshutdn.exe` is not found on W10 pro.

You can also perform shutdown and restart operations directly from Windows PowerShell as well.

To shut down the computer, use the `Stop-Computer` command

To restart the operating system, use the `Restart-Computer` command

To force an immediate restart, use the -Force parameter. `Restart-Computer -Force`


### Services (sc)

See the [Streamline Windows Batch File](#Batch-File) for more examples?

```bat
sc start vmms
sc queryex eventlog vmms
```

### VSSADMIN

Take a look and see where your computer is storing ShadowCopy Backups

`vssadmin list providers` list the things making shadowcopies.  Just Windows usually.

`vssadmin list volumes` -list the drives where shadow copies are kept

`vssadmin list shadows` - more interesting, lists the specific backups. Like this:

        Contents of shadow copy set ID: {91131afe-b83c-44cd-b243-142b8ed9d4b7}
        Contained 1 shadow copies at creation time: 3/24/2019 5:02:29 AM
            Shadow Copy ID: {db24bd58-fcb5-4fe4-877f-af5c43cadc5f}
                Original Volume: (X:)\\?\Volume{8e24b15f-7991-4509-bdcd-46e88aafab92}\
                Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy36
                Originating Machine: DESKTOP
                Service Machine: DESKTOP
                Provider: 'Microsoft Software Shadow Copy provider 1.0'
                Type: DataVolumeRollback
                Attributes: Persistent, No auto release, No writers, Differential

`vssadmin list shadowstorage` -shows by drive how much space is taken up and how much is left.
        Shadow Copy Storage association
        For volume: (P:)\\?\Volume{11696a83-1b1a-44da-b6af-a7dca2d81c33}\
        Shadow Copy Storage volume: (P:)\\?\Volume{11696a83-1b1a-44da-b6af-a7dca2d81c33}\
        Used Shadow Copy Storage space: 32.1 MB (0%)
        Allocated Shadow Copy Storage space: 5.12 GB (1%)
        Maximum Shadow Copy Storage space: 102 GB (26%)

`vssadmin list writers` - not that interesting lists services that use VSS. **Will tell you if there is an error from each service**

`vssadmin Resize ShadowStorage` -

`vssadmin Delete Shadows /For=C:`


### schtasks

#### Backup

!!!Warning Warning: This is a pop-up mess...Diasble Javascript before you go [Source](http://rareelement.tripod.com/winrar_sk.htm)

##### Full Backup
Intro: This is a backup of ALL the existing files in source folder.
Comment: This backup may be done once a while to get a complete snapshot of all the file at that moment.
Restoration: To restore a file, files can be directly retrieved from this archive (if no newer backup exists)

Command line:
`winrar.exe a -se -rr3% -ac -ag+YYYYMMDD_full_ -k -m5 -ms -os -r -ep1 e:\mydoc.rar @mydocpath.txt`

| command/switch | Purpose Used                                                     |

| -ac            | clear archive attribute after archival                           |
| -ag+YYYYMMDD_  | add current date in archive name                                 |
| -k             | protect archive from tamper or accidental modification           |
| -m5            | use best compression (also slowest)                              |
| -ms            | Do not waste time in re-compressing compressed files [2]         |
| -os            | keep NTFS streams (recommended if your files are stored on NTFS) |
| -r             | recurs subfolders                                                |

#####  Incremental Backup

Intro: Takes backup of the files modified since the last backup.

Comment: Takes very less time as only a small number of files are usually changed daily. These are the files backup up by this method.

Restoration: To restore a file, you need to first retrieve the last FULL backup, then ALL the incremental backups up to the date required in chronologically dated order, starting from the oldest to the latest.


Command Line: `winrar.exe a -se -rr3% -ac -ag+YYYYMMDD_incr_ -k -m4 -ms -os -r -ep1 -ac -ao e:\mydoc.rar @mydocpath.txt`

Command/switches used with purpose:

| command/switch           | Purpose Used                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| All from the FULL backup | As tabulate above                              |
| -ao                      | add only the files with archive bit on         |
| -m4                      | Replaced -m5 with -m4 for faster daily backups |
| REMOVE -m5               | Replaced -m5 with -m4 for faster daily backups |

##### Differential Backup

Intro: Takes backup of all files since the last FULL backup.

Comment: Takes more time to backup with time. This is because this backup backups up all files modified since the last FULL backup.

Restoration: To restore a file, retrieve the last FULL backup, and then the latest differential backup file.


Command Line: `winrar.exe a -se -rr3% -ag+YYYYMMDD_diff_ -k -m4 -ms -os -r -ep1 -ao e:\mydoc.rar @mydocpath.txt`

Command/switches used with purpose:

| All from the FULL backup | As tabulate above                                      |
| -ao                      | add only the files with archive bit on                 |
| REMOVE -ac               | to prevent the archive bit from changing due to backup |
| -m4                      | Replaced -m5 with -m4 for faster daily backups         |
| REMOVE -m5               | Replaced -m5 with -m4 for faster daily backups         |


### 7zip


 7z.exe a -t7z backup.7z -mx5 -m0=lzma2 -ms=200f -mmt=8
    "%inkscapePath%" --without-gui --file="%%cd%%\%%i" --export-png="%%cd%%\tmp\%%j\%%~ni-%%j.png" --export-dpi=%%j
    set /a innercount=innercount+1
7z a  \%fileName%.7z ".\*\*.png" -r -y -aoa -bse1 -bso0 -w".\tmp\" -m0=LZMAs=100f10m

- bsxy
comes in pairs x= (p - info, e- error, ? i forgot 3 debug maybe?) and y is 0 nowhere, 1 stdout 2 stderr the screen.

`-bse1 > Errorlog.txt` pipes out the error messages.
::-bse1 bs is redirect output and e is error and 1 is sted out
::-bso0 redirects standard output messages to 0 (off)

::setting methods is complicated af

methods
:: this is supposed to be the method  -m0=LZMA2s=100f10m
s=100f10m = solid format 100files or 10 Mb
- mx(1-9) sets default strength from store to ultra eg -mx1

Another example `7z.exe a -t7z backup.7z -mx1 -m0=lzma2:d=1024m:fb=273 -ms=16g -mmt=24`
- mmt=# is number of cpu threads
- ms=16g is solid, break into 16gb, can use b,k,m,g and f for files.
fb is fast bytes (IDK)
d: is directory size.T
There is a ton more.

 - aoa - append and overwrite

 - y dont ask

 - r subfolders.

 - w".\tmp\" workign directory?

 format is always 7z. then command.  a for add.  then archive.  The rest can be allegely any order.  Its confusing as hell

Single Letter Attribute Percent Escapes
Here are common single letter escapes (short form) is used to report the most common attributes and properties of an image, such as: the image filename filename, type, width, height.
- \n - newline
- \r - carriage return
- < - less-than character.
- > - greater-than character.
- & - ampersand character.
- %% - a percent sign
- %b - file size of image read in (use -precision 16 to force results in B)
- %c - comment meta-data property
- %d - directory component of path

!!!Note Note This information was gathered using: `magick montage -list | clip`  A neat trick if I dont say so myself.
This lists all the parameters that can be set.  the `list` command is supposed to bring up more information on the command.  `magic montage -list compress`

By default, the image format of 'file' is determined by its magic
number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename
with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the
image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as
'-' for standard input or output.

`magick montage *.svg "File-directory.png` works
`magick montage *.svg -label %t "File-directory.png` does not work
`magick montage -label %t -tile 5x *.svg  "File-directory.png` does  work
`magick montage -label %t -tile 10x20 *.png -resize 128x128  ..\FlatIcons(png)-index.html` does  work - out puts out1.png, out2.png
out.gif also works, about half the size. out.html produces html and a mapped png.


!!!code Top Example

        montage -label '%t'  -size 256x256 ./*.* -scale 256x256 -auto-orient -geometry +5+5 -tile 10x  -frame 5  -shadow -monitor ./_index-%d.html 

magick montage -label %t -tile 10x20 *.png -resize 128x128  .\%d-index.html

!!!code Convert an icon

        convert *.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 %t.ico
        magick convert *.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 "%t.ico"

       magick convert [name].svg -render -define icon:auto-resize [name].ico


!!!warning [From](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php)
        Some 'properties' must be defined in a specific way to be used. For example only 'properties' prefixed with "filename:" can be used to modify the output filename of an image. For example

        convert rose: -set filename:mysize '%wx%h' 'rose_%[filename:mysize].png'

  so then this works:

`magick convert xxx.svg -render -define icon:auto-resize -set filename:name %t '%[filename:name].ico'` only it leaves quotes

magick convert archway.svg -resize 512x512 -transparent #FFFFFF  -define icon:auto-resize   -set filename:name %t   %[filename:name].ico

still with problems but the closest Ive gotten

the background is infact listed as white- using `magick identify -verbose archway.svg`

using `magick mogrify archway.svg -background #00000000` destroyed the image.

`magick convert arrow.svg -background #00000000 -define rsvg %[basename]2.svg` - bad


`convert -density 384 -background transparent -fill "#607D8B" -colorize 100 favicon.svg -define icon:auto-resize -colors 256 favicon.ico` [source](https://gist.github.com/azam/3b6995a29b9f079282f3)

`magick convert  -density 384 -background transparent -fill "#607D8B" -colorize 100 arrow.svg  -define icon:auto-resize -colors 256 %[basename]2.ico` name not working

!!!success THIS WORKS! Where fill is the output color.
    magick convert  -density 384 -background transparent -fill "#607D8B" -colorize 100 arrow.svg  -define icon:auto-resize -colors 256 -set filename:name %t   %[filename:name].ico

magick convert  -density 256x256 -background transparent -fill "#607D8B" -colorize 100 arrow.svg  -define icon:auto-resize -colors 256 -set filename:name %t   %[filename:name]2.ico

### Graphics Magic


!!!note This works:
    gm montage -geometry 256x256x10x10 -thumnail 256x256 -tile 25x25 *.svg _ImageDirectory.html

    Somewhat

    Though many svg's fail.

### Fix DICOM Errors

!!!Important
Need [Grant, Revoke, Get DCOM permissions using PowerShell](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Grant-Revoke-Get-DCOM-22da5b96)
It can be installed via ScriptBrowser

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\andyt\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts\Grant-Revoke-Get-DCOM-22da5b96\DCOMPermissions"
Import-Module .\DCOMPermissions.psm1
Grant-DComPermission -ApplicationID "{4839DDB7-58C2-48F5-8283-E1D1807D0D7D}" -Account "SYSTEM" -Type Launch -Permissions LocalLaunch,LocalActivation -OverrideConfigurationPermissions
```


### Shimgen

Using the .Net and Chocolatey Shimgen has been super useful.

First copy it from `%ChocolateyInstall%\tools` to `%ChocolateyInstall%\bin` so its on **PATH**.  (I cant remember if You need to add \bin to path or it comes that way?)  Anyway- Add `C:\ProgramData\Chocolatey\bin` to path.

Then run

```batch
cd /d %ChocolateyInstall%\tools
copy shimgen.exe ..\bin
shimgen -o="kdiff.exe" -p="..\..\..\Program Files\Kdiff3\Kdiff3.exe" -i=".\kdiff3.exe" --gui
```

Somehow shimgen knows to put things in Chocolatey\bin, so paths are relative to that.  Even attempting to put it in another folder fails- by explicitly setting output.  Will work fine like this though  You hae to generate a a relative path from the `C:\ProgramData\Chocolatey\bin` back to the file.

!!!Note - The Easy Way- go to directory of SOURCE - in this case winrar
    `c:\Program Files\WinRAR>shimgen -o='WinRar.exe' -p="%cd%\WinRAR.exe" -i=.\WinRAR.exe --gui`

## Registry

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Cursors

### Registry Changes

Syntax of .Reg Files
A .reg file has the following syntax:

```txt
RegistryEditorVersion
Blank line
[RegistryPath1]

"DataItemName1"="DataType1:DataValue1"
DataItemName2"="DataType2:DataValue2"
Blank line
[RegistryPath2]

"DataItemName3"="DataType3:DataValue3"
```

where:

`RegistryEditorVersion` is either `"Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00"` for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, or `"REGEDIT4"` for Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0. The "REGEDIT4" header also works on Windows 2000-based, Windows XP-based, and Windows Server 2003-based computers.

Blank line is a blank line. This identifies the start of a new registry path. Each key or subkey is a new registry path. If you have several keys in your .reg file, blank lines can help you to examine and to troubleshoot the contents.
RegistryPathx is the path of the subkey that holds the first value you are importing. Enclose the path in square brackets, and separate each level of the hierarchy by a backslash. For example:
[HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System]
A .reg file can contain several registry paths. If the bottom of the hierarchy in the path statement does not exist in the registry, a new subkey is created. The contents of the registry files are sent to the registry in the order you enter them. Therefore, if you want to create a new subkey with another subkey below it, you must enter the lines in the correct order.

DataItemNamex is the name of the data item that you want to import. If a data item in your file does not exist in the registry, the .reg file adds it (with the value of the data item). If a data item does exist, the value in your .reg file overwrites the existing value. Quotation marks enclose the name of the data item. An equal sign (=) immediately follows the name of the data item.

DataTypex is the data type for the registry value and immediately follows the equal sign. For all the data types other than REG_SZ (a string value), a colon immediately follows the data type. If the data type is REG_SZ , do not include the data type value or colon. In this case, Regedit.exe assumes REG_SZ for the data type. The following table lists the typical registry data types:

- REG_BINARY - hexadecimal
- REG_DWORD - dword
- REG_EXPAND_SZ - hexadecimal(2)
- REG_MULTI_SZ - hexadecimal(7)
-

### Adding Registry Subkeys or Adding and Changing Registry Values

To add a registry subkey or add or change a registry value, make the appropriate changes in the registry, and then export the appropriate subkey or subkeys. Exported registry subkeys are automatically saved as .reg files. To make changes to the registry and export your changes to a .reg file, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.
2. Locate and then click the subkey that holds the registry item or items that you want to change.
3. Click File, and then click Export.

This step backs up the subkey before you make any changes. You can import this file back into the registry later if your changes cause a problem. In the File name box, type a file name to use to save the .reg file with the original registry items, and then click Save.

!!!Note Use a file name that reminds you of the contents, such as a reference to the name of the subkey.
In the right pane, add or modify the registry items you want.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 to export the subkey again, but use a different file name for the .reg file. You can use this .reg file to make your registry changes on another computer.
Test your changes on the local computer. If they cause a problem, double-click the file that holds the backup of the original registry data to return the registry to its original state. If the changes work as expected, you can distribute the .reg you created in step 6 to other computers by using the methods in the "Distributing Registry Changes" section of this article.

### Deleting Registry Keys and Values

To delete a registry key with a .reg file, put a hyphen (-) in front of the RegistryPath in the .reg file. For example, to delete the Test subkey from the following registry key:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software`
put a hyphen in front of the following registry key in the .reg file:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test`
The following example has a .reg file that can perform this task.
`[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test]`
To delete a registry value with a .reg file, put a hyphen (-) after the equals sign following the DataItemName in the .reg file. For example, to delete the TestValue registry value from the following registry key:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test`
put a hyphen after the "TestValue"= in the .reg file. The following example has a .reg file that can perform this task.
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test`

`"TestValue"=-`
To create the .reg file, use Regedit.exe to export the registry key that you want to delete, and then use Notepad to edit the .reg file and insert the hyphen.

Renaming Registry Keys and Values
To rename a key or value, delete the key or value, and then create a new key or value with the new name.

### Setting Explorer to My PC not Quick Access

```batch
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced" /v "LaunchTo" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```


### Batch Examples

```batch
@echo off
Setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
:: strLen String [RtnVar]
::             -- String  The string to be measured, surround in quotes if it contains spaces.
::             -- RtnVar  An optional variable to be used to return the string length.
Set "s=#%~1"
Set "len=0"
For %%N in (4096 2048 1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1) do (

## MSI Executables

For example: `msiexec /a "C:\users\altimmons\downloads\python-2.7.15.amd64.msi" /lemox "./temp.txt"`

The above command says using msiexec (windows installer), run as an admin `/a` this file, `/l` log it, and in the log put- I dont remember all the other letters e is errors. x is more info I think. Save it in the local directory `./temp.txt`.

you can say program /? for more info

## Setup Git

First setup basics

```bash
git config --global user.name "altimmons"
git config --global user.email "A.L.Timmons@gmail.com"
```

Then generate an SSH key to upload to github

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "A.L.Timmons@gmail.com"
```

This is best done with wsl

!!!Note Note- The link- `Microsoft VS RegExp` suggests an older easier form of RegExp thats worth checking out if this isnt working

- Wildcards
  - `.` - 1   match a single char (any, except new line `\n`)
  - `*` - 0+  - zero or more occurances.
  - `+` - 1+  -one or more occurances.  Requires its occurance.
  - `?` - match 0 or more, but as few characters as possible (?).
    - `.+`  = one or more of any char **As above- this is a (non-null) Wildcard**
    - `.*` = zero or more of any char.  **This is a wildcard functionally**
    - `*?`,`+?`, `??`, `{#...}?` Lazy modifiers of the above.
  - {#} - specify the number of times something *preceeding* should occur.  Goes after. `[0-9]{3} = 142 or 999`
    - {#,#} - specify a range of occurances.  e.g. [0-9]{2,4}  match 10 - 9999
    - {#,} - match at least # times
- Anchors
  - `^` - anchor to front
  - `\r?$` -anchor to rear.  Old character was just `$`
- Parens and brackets
  - [...] - give characters to match.
    - [\], [c] - match a single char
    - [a-f], [0-9] - match a range
    - [pre], [.)-] - match a single character in a set. [abc] = a, b, c not d, matches a in aa.
  - (...) - specify a string to search for
    - (...) -> `\1` define a pattern then Reference it later (in the same pattern) with \1 (\2, \3) etc.  `({3}[x])z\1 = xxxzxxx`
    - (...) -> `$1` - in replacements, VS 2011+ replaced \1 with $1.
- Logic
  - `?!` = NOT , `real(?!ity)` matched real and really but not reality.
  - [^...] - NOT in set - as above for brackets, but invalidates `be[^abc]` does not match bear but would match bee.
  - `|` = OR - Match either the sequence before or after. `([0-9]|[a-f]|[^g-z])` - to find hex `#([0-9]|[a-f]){6}` find hex colors
- Types
  - `(\b\S+\s?){1,}`  USEFUL- find words - start at word boundary -repeat to go to non-space- find 0 or 1 space- then all of it {1,}- one or more words.
  - `\p{...}` match a type
  - `\b` -specifies a word boundary- usually a space `\bin` matches inside but not bin.
  - `\r?\n` - line break carriage return.   This is system independent - 0 or more \r (returns), then \n.  Or at least Unix/Win
  - `(?([^\r\n])\s)` Whitespace
  - `\d` digit
  - \u#### -unicode (specific char)
  - `((\".+?\")|('.+?'))` = quoted string
  - `\b0[xX]([0-9a-fA-F])\b` matches hex- Matches "0xc67f" but not "0xc67fc67f".
  - `\b[0-9]*\.*[0-9]+\b` int and floats.
- Characters
  - `\` -escape character - e.g. `\.` is a literal `.` not anychar.
  - \b - word boundary
  - \t tab character (\u0009)
  - \r carriage return \u000D
  - \v vert tab
  - \f form feed
  - `\n` new line (\u000A)
  - `\e` escape \u001b

Group Referencing (Reusing a previously used group)
- `(exp)` Indexed group
- `(?<name>exp)` -  Named group
- `(?<name1-name2>exp)` - Balancing group

Greedy Lazy Matches
0 or more times | `*` Greedy `*?`  Lazy
1 or more times | `+` Greedy  `+?`  Lacy
 `?` |  `??` Lazy 0 or 1 time |
`{n}` `{n}?` Exactly n times
`{n,}` `{n,}?` At least n times
`{n,m}` `{n,m}?` From n to m times

| Greedy    | Lazy       | Matches           |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| `*`       | `*?`       | 0 or more times   |
| `+`       | `+?`       | 1 or more times   |
| `?`       | `??`       | 0 or 1 time       |
| `{`n`}`   | `{`n`}?`   | Exactly n times   |
| `{`n,`}`  | `{`n,`}?`  | At least n times  |
| `{`n,m`}` | `{`n,m`}?` | From n to m times |

Note- `{n,m}` and similar are recorded weird because they disappear from table when entered verbatim, it must be the format of the table code.


The regular expression pattern \b`(?<n2>\d{2}-)?``(?(n2)``\d{7}`|`\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}`)\b is interpreted as shown in the following table.

Pattern  Description
- `\b`  Start at a word boundary.
- `(?<n2>\d{2}-)?` Match zero or one occurrence of two digits followed by a hyphen. Name this capturing group n2.
- `(?(n2)`  Test whether n2 was matched in the input string.
- `)\d{7}`   If n2 was matched, match seven decimal digits.
- `|\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}` If n2 was not matched, match three decimal digits, a hyphen, two decimal digits, another hyphen, and four decimal digits.
- `\b`  Match a word boundary.

      string input;

      foreach (var address in addresses) {

## Other Tips, Tricks and Hacks

### Get any programs location using the registry.

This is in powershell
```ps1
>#get the path to 7-zip from the registry
$7zip = Join-Path (get-item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\7-Zip).GetValue('Path') '7z.exe'
```
The commandline has an equivalent (Reg)

```batch
>reg Query HKLM\Software\7-Zip

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\7-Zip
    Path64    REG_SZ    C:\Program Files\7-Zip\
    Path    REG_SZ    C:\Program Files\7-Zip\
```

Not sure how youd parse the output

### Norives


Hide drive mappings in 'My Computer', Windows Explorer and the standard Open dialog box.

Each letter is one bit more in binary.

So drive A(1) = 1, drive B(2)=2, driveC(3)=4, D=8, E=16 and so on.

Copy the result into the registry to hide the drive letter(s)

User Key:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer]

System Key:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer]

Value Name: NoDrives
Data Type: DWORD

After changing the registry, logoff or reboot so that it takes effect.

Drive mappings hidden with a nodrives registry setting are still available, just type the drive letter into the explorer address bar.


### Setting Explorer to My PC not Quick Access

```batch
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced" /v "LaunchTo" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

## Stop Web ASsembly

[About Wasm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)

[Source](https://github.com/stevespringett/disable-webassembly#disabling-guidance)


### Disabling Guidance



!!!warning FireFox

    Enter `about:config` in the URL bar and change javascript.options.wasm to false

!!!note Chrome/Chromium

    Chrome must be launched with the following command-line argument: --js-flags=--noexpose_wasm. On Windows and Linux/Unix, simply appending the argument after the chrome executable is all that's required. For example:

        chrome --js-flags=--noexpose_wasm
    
    Should work on Chrome Clonesm as well. e.g. Brave, etcv.

!!!bug On macOS, the syntax is a bit different.

      open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --js-flags=--noexpose_wasm


On Windows, modifying the registry may also be beneficial in order to maintain state between Chrome auto-updates.

    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ChromeHTML\shell\open\command
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\http\shell\open\command
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\https\shell\open\command

Uncheck the write permission on these keys so that the changes persist on next auto-update of Chrome. Thanks to @tophf for providing information about the flag and registry settings.
