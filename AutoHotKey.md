## Expression vs Legacy Mode


Some commands are bizarrely mixed - 
`WinGet, WinList,  List, %Title%`

This example uses string concatenation with `.`. THe second example Uses expression mode `%` to declare that strings are quoted and variables are unquoted.  
```ahk
if WinExist("ahk_class Notepad") or WinExist("ahk_class" . ClassName)
    WinActivate  ; Uses the last found window.

MsgBox % "The active window's ID is " . WinExist("A")
MsgBox  The active window's ID is %SomeVar%
```

```ahk
;Legacy mode [=]
vNum = 123
vString = This is a string ;Unquoted
vThisIsACopyofaVar = %myVar% ;Note percent signs

MsgBox The value in the variable named Var is %Var%.
CopyOfVar = %Var%


;Expression mode assignment :=
vNum := 123 ;the same
vString := "This is a String" ;Requires quotes
vThisIsACopyofaVar := myVar ;No Percent Signs

MsgBox % "The value in the variable named Var is " . Var . "."  ; A period is used to concatenate (join) two strings.
CopyOfVar := Var

```

for example- these are equivalent

```ahk
myvar = %A_AppData%\ICA Client\
MsgBox, %myvar%
myvar := A_AppData "\ICA Client\ "
myvar := A_AppData . "\ICA Client\ " ;Maybe this requires a period.
MsgBox, %myvar%
```

**Empty strings:** To specify an empty string in an expression, use an empty pair of quotes. For example, the statement if (MyVar <> "") would be true if MyVar is not blank. However, in a traditional-if, a pair of empty quotes is treated literally. For example, the statement if MyVar = "" is true only if MyVar contains an actual pair of quotes. Thus, to check if a variable is blank with a traditional-if, use = or <> with nothing on the right side as in this example:

```ahk
vMyString :=

if (vMyString = "") {
    MsgBox, String is Blank
}
;However, this evaluates as false (there is a string value), the msgbox is not displayed.  Its actually looking for literally vMyString := "" (two double quotes)

if(vMyString = )

if Var =
```

Assigning Values is also odd:

```ahk
MyVar =
MyVar := ""
```

Both of these store blank values. But `MyVar = ""` will store `""`.

###  Storing values in variables: 

To store a string or number in a variable, there are two methods: `legacy` and `expression`. 

The `legacy` method uses the equal sign operator (`=`) to assign **unquoted literal strings** or **variables enclosed in percent signs.** For example:

```ahk
MyNumber = 123
MyString = This is a literal string.
CopyOfVar = %Var%  ; With the = operator, percent signs are required to retrieve a variable's contents.
```

By contrast, the `expression` method uses the colon-equal operator (`:=`) to store **numbers,** **quoted strings,** and other types of expressions. The following examples are functionally identical to the previous ones:

```ahk
MyNumber := 123
MyString := "This is a literal string."
CopyOfVar := Var  ; Unlike its counterpart in the previous section, percent signs are not used with the := operator.
```

The *latter method is preferred by* many due to its greater clarity, and because it supports an expression syntax nearly identical to that in many other languages.

You may have guessed from the above that there are two methods to erase the contents of a variable (that is, to make it blank):

        MyVar =
        MyVar := ""

The empty pair of quotes above should be used only with the := operator because if it were used with the = operator, it would store two literal quote-characters inside the variable.

Retrieving the contents of variables: Like the two methods of storing values, there are also two methods for retrieving them: legacy and expression. The legacy method requires that each variable name be enclosed in percent signs to retrieve its contents. For example:

        MsgBox The value in the variable named Var is %Var%.
        CopyOfVar = %Var%

By contrast, the expression method omits the percent signs around variable names, but encloses literal strings in quotes. Thus, the following are the expression equivalents of the previous examples:

        MsgBox % "The value in the variable named Var is " . Var . "."  ; A period is used to concatenate (join) two strings.
        CopyOfVar := Var

In the MsgBox line above, a percent sign and a space is used to change the parameter from legacy to expression mode. This is necessary because the legacy method is used by default by all commands, except where otherwise documented.

Comparing variables: Please read the expressions section below for important notes about the different kinds of comparisons, especially about when to use parentheses.

### Legacy syntax

Legacy Syntax

Legacy or command syntax generally only allows a single action per line, but uses fewer characters to perform simple tasks such as sending keystrokes or running a program. The syntax consists of command and variable names, unquoted text and a few symbols such as ,, = and %.

Unquoted text is simply text, not enclosed in quote marks, just straight up. Since the text has no explicit start and end marks, it ends at the end of the line or the end of the parameter. Leading and trailing spaces and tabs are ignored. Within unquoted text, the following characters have special meaning:

•`%`: Enclose a variable name in percent signs to include the contents of that variable. For example, The year is %A_Year%.

!!!Note: Variable names are not always enclosed in percent signs; they are required only within unquoted text. Percent signs should not be used anywhere else, except to create a dynamic variable reference or dynamic function call. 

!!!Note: Only a plain variable name can be used. Array elements, properties and other expressions are not supported. 

•`,`: Comma is used to delimit (separate) the parameters of a command, with some exceptions. It has no special meaning when used in an assignment or comparison, so is interpreted literally in such cases.

**•\`:** An escape character is usually used to indicate that the character immediately following it should be interpreted differently than it normally would. For example, \`% produces a literal percent sign and **\`,** produces a literal comma. Some other common escape sequences produce special characters, such as **\`t** (tab), **\`n** (linefeed), and **\`r** (carriage return).

Commands accept a mixture of unquoted text, variable names and numeric expressions. `Send, The time is %A_Hour% o'clock.`

Legacy assignment assigns unquoted text to a variable. `Clipboard = This text is copied to the clipboard.`

If statements perform an action only if the specified condition is met.  `If Var = Text value`

There are also several other control flow statements (such as loops) which use legacy syntax similar to commands.

## Setup

### Directives

- #SingleInstance, Force|Ignore|Off
- #Persistent =If this directive is present anywhere in the script, that script will stay running after the auto-execute section.  Also, implies SingleInstance, though this can be over-ridden.
- #EscapeChar (`) - the default is backtick 
- #DerefChar (%)e.g. #  ; Change it from its normal default, which is %.
- #Delimiter (,)\  ; Change it from its normal default, which is comma.\
- #HotkeyModifierTimeout - in milliseconds, the delay waiting for key combo, -1 is infinite.
- #MaxThreadsBuffer - [(Off)|On] -default is off, says that if a hot key is already running its routine, another press is ignored.  Turning this on, buffers the action, and sends it when the other finishes.  Need to change the number of threads too.
- #MaxThreadsPerHotKey [(1)-20] - default 1, the number of simultaneous instances. Up to MaxThreads obviously.
- #MaxThreads - [1-(10)-255] the number of threads, default is 10.
- #MaxMem (Mb) [0-(64)-4096] Default is 64- The number of mb *per* var
- #HotKeyInterval (millis) - Default is 2000, 
- #MaxHotKeysPerInterval (int) -Default is 70, with the above, will display an error dialogue if exceeded - e.g. 70 hot key calls in 2 seconds.
- ~~#AllowSameLineComments~~ Deprecated. Default enabled
- #InputLevel [(0)-100] - See levels, sets a level to send keys, a higher level input (artificial key stroke), will be interpreted by a lower level hotkey as if it were hit normally.  By Default all are 0, so you cannot trigger a hotkey yourself (unless you change this.)
- #ClipboardTimeout (millis)[-1|0|(1000)-?max] - sets how long to wait on getting clipboard data, 
- #Hotstring [NoMouse|EndChars NewChars|New Options]
  - NoMouse keeps mouse from resetting hotstring recognizer if the mouse is moved
  - EndChars (NewChars) - `#Hotstring EndChars -()[]{}':;"/\,.?!``n ``t`  changes the endchars for hostrings.
  - NewOptions -specify new options - see hotkey option
- #IF(expression) Creates Context Sensitive Hotkeys.
- #IfTimeout - Sets the maximum time that may be spent evaluating a single #If expression. Note that the system implements its own timeout, defined by the DWORD value LowLevelHooksTimeout in the following registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`
- #IfWin(Not)Active/Exist
- #InstallKeybdHook
- #InstallMouseHook
- #UseHook (On)|((Off)) - Forces the use of the hook to implement all or some keyboard hotkeys. Default is off, Using the command without specifying defaults to On.
- #CommentFlag (;)Char(s) -specify what comments should look like.
- #ErrorStdOut - Sends any syntax error that prevents a script from launching to stderr rather than displaying a dialog.
- #Include FileOrDirName
- #Include <LibName>
- #IncludeAgain FileOrDirName
- #MenuMaskKey - Changes which key is used to mask Win or Alt keyup events.A key name or VKnn sequence which specifies a non-zero virtual keycode.  The mask key is sent automatically to prevent the Start menu or the active window's menu bar from activating at unexpected times.

## Basics

### Include

A script may call a function in an external file without having to use #Include. For this to work, a file of the same name as the function must exist in one of the following library directories:

`%A_ScriptDir%\Lib\` ; Local library
`%A_MyDocuments%\AutoHotkey\Lib\`  ; User library.
`directory-of-the-currently-running-AutoHotkey.exe\Lib\`  ; Standard library.



- #Include FileOrDirName
- #Include <LibName>
- #IncludeAgain FileOrDirName

`FileOrDirName`
The path of a file or directory as explained below. **This must not contain double quotes, wildcards, or references to non-built-in variables.** Escape sequences other than semicolon (`;) must not be used, nor are they needed because characters such as percent signs are treated literally.

Percent signs which are not part of a valid variable reference are interpreted literally. All built-in variables are valid, except for ErrorLevel, A_Args and the numbered variables. Prior to [v1.1.28], only %A_ScriptDir%, %A_AppData%, %A_AppDataCommon% and [in v1.1.11+] %A_LineFile% were supported.

    The FileName parameter may optionally be preceded by *i and a single space, which causes the program to ignore any failure to read the included file. For example: #Include *i SpecialOptions.ahk. This option should be used only when the included file's contents are not essential to the main script's operation.

`File`: The name of the file to be included, which **is assumed to be in the startup/working directory if an absolute path is not specified** (except for ahk2exe, which assumes the file is in the script's own directory). Note: SetWorkingDir has no effect on #Include because #Include is processed before the script begins executing.

Directory: Specify a directory instead of a file to change the working directory used by all subsequent occurrences of #Include and FileInstall. Note: Changing the working directory in this way does not affect the script's initial working directory when it starts running (A_WorkingDir). To change that, use SetWorkingDir at the top of the script.
LibName
 A library file or function name. For example, #include <lib> and #include <lib_func> would both include lib.ahk from one of the function library folders. LibName cannot contain variable references.

Use %A_LineFile%\.. to refer to the directory which contains the current file, even if it is not the main script file. For example, #Include %A_LineFile%\..\other.ahk.

%A_AhkPath%\.. can be used to refer to the directory containing AutoHotkey.exe


### Suspend

`Suspend, [Mode]`
Mode
- On: Suspends all hotkeys and hotstrings except those explained the Remarks section.
- Off: Re-enables the hotkeys and hotstrings that were disable above.
- Toggle (default): Changes to the opposite of its previous state (On or Off).
- Permit: Does nothing except mark the current subroutine as being exempt from suspension.

The decimal values 1, 0 and -1 may be used in place of On, Off and Toggle, respectively.


### Exit vs ExitApp

`Exit` will not terminate a persistent script; it terminates only the current thread. `ExitApp` terminates all.  In a non-persistent app, then Exit will terminate the main thread, and the rest will terminate as they complete.

If `#Persistent` is added to an existing script, you might want to change some or all occurrences of Exit to be ExitApp.

### Clipboard

Var = %Clipboard% and Clipboard = New Text.
.
You can also pipe the output directly to the clipboard by downloading cb.zip¬ (4 KB) and then following this example:
`"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" 2>&1 |cb.exe`

### StdOut

Because AutoHotkey is not a console program, errors will not appear at the command prompt directly. Instead, such output can be captured via piping or redirection. For example:
`"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" 2>&1 |more`
`"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" 2>"Syntax-Error Log.txt"`

Standard Output (stdout): Specifying an asterisk (*) for Filename causes Text to be sent to standard output (stdout). Such text can be redirected to a file, piped to another EXE, or captured by fancy text editors. For example, the following would be valid if typed at a command prompt:
`"%ProgramFiles%\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" "My Script.ahk" >"Error Log.txt"`


However, text sent to stdout will not appear at the command prompt it was launched from. This can be worked around by piping a script's output to another command or program. For example:
`"%ProgramFiles%\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" "My Script.ahk" |more`
`For /F "tokens=*" %L in ('""%ProgramFiles%\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" "My Script .ahk""') do @Echo %L`

`OutputDebug, Text`

#### Debugging

Debugging a Script

Commands such as ListVars and Pause can help you debug a script. For example, the following two lines, when temporarily inserted at carefully chosen positions, create "break points" in the script:
ListVars
Pause



### Files

FileAppend

`FileAppend, Another line.``n, C:\My Documents\Test.txt`

```ahk
; The following example demonstrates how to automate FTP uploading using the operating 
; system's built-in FTP command. This script has been tested on Windows XP.

FTPCommandFile = %A_ScriptDir%\FTPCommands.txt
FTPLogFile = %A_ScriptDir%\FTPLog.txt
FileDelete %FTPCommandFile%  ; In case previous run was terminated prematurely.

FileAppend,  ; The comma is required in this case.

), %FTPCommandFile%

RunWait %ComSpec% /c ftp.exe -s:"%FTPCommandFile%" >"%FTPLogFile%"
FileDelete %FTPCommandFile%  ; Delete for security reasons.
Run %FTPLogFile%  ; Display the log for review.
```

### Hotkeys Settings

#### Keys

SCnnn Specify for nnn the scan code of a key. Recognizes unusual keys not mentioned above. See Special Keys for details. 

VKnn - Specify for nn the hexadecimal virtual key code of a key. This rarely-used method also prevents certain types of hotkeys from requiring the keyboard hook. For example, the following hotkey does not use the keyboard hook, but as a side-effect it is triggered by pressing either Home or NumpadHome:

`^VK24::MsgBox You pressed Home or NumpadHome while holding down Control.`

Known limitation: VK hotkeys that are forced to use the keyboard hook, such as *VK24 or ~VK24, will fire for only one of the keys, not both (e.g. NumpadHome but not Home).For more information about the VKnn method, see Special Keys.
 
Warning: Only Send, GetKeyName, GetKeyVK, GetKeySC and #MenuMaskKey support combining VKnn and SCnnn. 

[v1.1.27+]: The presence of an invalid suffix prevents VKnn from being recognized. For example, vk1Bsc001:: raises an error in v1.1.27+, but sc001 was ignored (had no effect) in previous versions.

####  MenuMaskKey

#MenuMaskKey setting

See MenuMaskKey settings

The mask key is sent automatically to prevent the Start menu or the active window's menu bar from activating at unexpected times.

The default mask key is [[Ctrl]] This directive can be used to change the mask key to a key with fewer side effects.

Good candidates are virtual key codes which generally have no effect, such as vk07, which Microsoft documents as "undefined", or vkFF, which is reserved to mean "no mapping" (a key which has no function). [v1.1.28+]: Both the VK and SC can be specified, and are not required to match an existing key. Specifying vk00sc000 will disable all automatic masking. Some values, such as zero VK with non-zero SC, may fail to suppress the Start menu.



#### Hooks



Normally, the windows API function `RegisterHotkey()` is used to implement a keyboard hotkey whenever possible. However, the responsiveness of hotkeys might be better under some conditions if the keyboard hook is used instead.

Turning this directive ON is equivalent to using the $ prefix in the definition of each affected hotkey.

As with all # directives -- which are processed only once when the script is launched -- #UseHook should not be positioned in the script as though it were a command (that is, it is not necessary to have it contained within a subroutine). Instead, position it immediately before the first hotkey label you wish to have affected by it.

By default, hotkeys that use the keyboard hook cannot be triggered by means of the Send command. Similarly, mouse hotkeys cannot be triggered by commands such as Click because all mouse hotkeys use the mouse hook. One workaround is to use Gosub to jump directly to the hotkey's subroutine. For example: `Gosub #LButton`.

- #InstallKeybdHook 
- #InstallMouseHook

Unneccessary, the script will install if needed.  Cost about 500kb memory- 450 for keyboard.

#### Levels

`SendLevel, #` sets the level for the current thread.  Equivalent to `#InputLevel` directive. `A_SendLevel` contains the current setting.  Determines the relative level= Controls which artificial keyboard and mouse events are ignored by hotkeys and hotstrings.

```ahk
; This may be defined in a separate script:
::btw::by the way

Send btw{Space} ; Does not produce "by the way ".

SendLevel 1
Send btw{Space} ; Produces "by the way ".
```
By default, hook hotkeys and hotstrings ignore keyboard and mouse events generated by any AutoHotkey script. In some cases it can be useful to override this behaviour; for instance, to allow a remapped key to be used to trigger other hotkeys.

## Variables

### Types

AutoHotkey supports these types of values:
- Strings (text)
- Numbers (integers and floating-point numbers)
- Objects
Some other related concepts:
- Boolean
- Nothing

#### `Typeof`

- `integer` (decimal, hexadecimal, float and integer, positive and negative)
- `float`
- `number` (integer or floating point)
- `digit` - a numerical character
- `xdigit` - a hexa numerical character (number + A-F)
- `alpha` character- not numbers, punct, spaces
- `upper` uppercase chars
- `lower` -lowercase chars
- `alnum` -alpha + digit (alphanumeric A-Z 0-9)
- `space` - True if Var is empty or contains only whitespace, which consists of the following characters: space (`%A_Space%`), tab (%A_Tab% or \`t), linefeed (\`n), return (\`r), vertical tab (\`v), and formfeed (\`f)
- `time`-True if Var contains a valid date-time stamp, which can be all or just the leading part of the YYYYMMDDHH24MISS format. For example, a 4-digit string such as 2004 is considered valid. Use StringLen to determine whether additional time components are present.
- `date` -equivalent to the above

#### Namespace (Global and Local Variables)

**Local variables** are specific to a single function and are visible only inside that function. Consequently, a local variable may have the same name as a global variable and both will have separate contents. Separate functions may also safely use the same variable names. All local variables which are not static are automatically freed (made empty) when the function returns.

Built-in variables such as `Clipboard`, `ErrorLevel`, and `A_TimeIdle` are never local (they can be accessed from anywhere), and cannot be re-declared.

Functions are _assume-local by default_. Variables accessed or created inside an assume-local function are local by default, with the following exceptions:

- `Super-global` variables, including classes.
- A dynamic variable reference may resolve to an existing global variable if no local variable exists by that name.
- Commands that create pseudo-arrays may create all elements as global even if only the first element is declared.

The default may also be overridden as shown below (by declaring the variable or by changing the mode of the function).

**Force-local mode**

[v1.1.27+]: If the function's first line is the word "`local`", all variable references (even dynamic ones) are assumed to be local unless they are declared as global inside the function. Unlike the default mode, force-local mode has the following behavior:

- Super-global variables (including classes) cannot be accessed without declaring them inside the function.
- Dynamic variable references follow the same rules as non-dynamic ones. Only global variables which are declared inside the function can be accessed.
- `StringSplit` and other commands which create pseudo-arrays follow the same rules as non-dynamic variable references (avoiding a common source of confusion).
- The `LocalSameAsGlobal` warning is never raised for variables within a force-local function.

**Global variables**
Assume-global mode: If a function needs to access or create a large number of global variables, it can be defined to assume that all its variables are global (except its parameters) by making its first line either the word "`global`" or the declaration of a local variable.

For example:

```ahk
    SetDefaults()
    {
        global  ; This word may be omitted if the first line of this function will be something like "local MyVar".
        MyGlobal := 33  ; Assigns 33 to a global variable, first creating the variable if necessary.
        local x, y:=0, z  ; Local variables must be declared in this mode, otherwise they would be assumed global.
    }
```

This assume-global mode can also be used by a function to create a global array, such as a loop that assigns values to `Array%A_Index%`.

**Super-global variables** [v1.1.05+]:
If a global declaration appears outside of any function, it takes effect for all functions by default (excluding force-local functions). This avoids the need to redeclare the variable in each function. However, if a function parameter or local variable with the same name is declared, it takes precedence over the global variable. Variables created by the class keyword are also super-global.

Static variables

Static variables are always implicitly local, but differ from locals because their values are remembered between calls. For example:

```ahk
LogToFile(TextToLog)
    {
        static LoggedLines = 0
        LoggedLines += 1 ; Maintain a tally locally (its value is remembered between calls).
        global LogFileName
        FileAppend, %LoggedLines%: %TextToLog%`n, %LogFileName%
    }
```

**Static Initializers:** In versions prior to 1.0.46, all static variables started off blank; so the only way to detect that one was being used for the first time was to check whether it was blank. A static variable may be initialized to something other than "" by following it with := or = followed by one of the following: true, false, a literal integer, a literal floating point number, or a literal/quoted string such as "fox". For example: static X:=0, Y:="fox". Each static variable is initialized only once (before the script begins executing).

`Static var := expression` is supported. All such expressions are evaluated immediately before the script's auto-execute section in the order they are encountered in the script.

**Assume-static mode:** A function may be defined to assume that all its variables are static (except its parameters) by making its first line the word "static". For example:

```ahk
GetFromStaticArray(WhichItemNumber)
{
    static
    static FirstCallToUs := true ; A static declaration's initializer still runs only once (upon startup).
    if FirstCallToUs ; Create a static array during the first call, but not on subsequent calls.
    {
        FirstCallToUs := false
        Loop 10
        StaticArray%A_Index% := "Value #" . A_Index
    }
    return StaticArray%WhichItemNumber%
}
```

In assume-static mode, any variable that should not be static must be declared as local or global (with the same exceptions as for assume-local mode, unless force-local mode is also in effect).

Force-local mode can be combined with assume-static mode by specifying local and then static, as shown below. This allows the function to use force-local rules but create variables as static by default.

```ahk
global MyVar := "This is global"
DemonstrateForceStatic()

DemonstrateForceStatic()
{
    local
    static
    MyVar := "This is static"
    ListVars
    MsgBox
}
```

### Operators

**x.y:** Object access
`%Var%` - If a variable is enclosed in percent signs within an expression (e.g. `%Var%`), whatever that variable contains is assumed to be the name or partial name of another variable (if there is no such variable, `%Var%` resolves to a blank string).

Creates a new object derived from another object. For example, `x := new y` is often equivalent to `x := {base: y}`. new should be followed by a variable or simple class name of the form GlobalClass.NestedClass, and optionally parameters as in `x := new y(z)`
++,-- Pre- and post-increment/decrement
`Var := ++X` increments X immediately and then assigns its value to Var.
`Var := X++` increments X only after assigning the current value of X to Var
**Note:** Due to backward compatibility, the operators ++ and -- treat blank variables as zero, but only when they are alone on a line; for example, y:=1, ++x and MsgBox % ++x both produce a blank result when x is blank.
** Power.
**Note:** Negative base with a fractional Exponent will produce an error `(-2)**0.5`Unary minus (-): Applies to a single expression (its a negative)`-(3 / -x)`. The opposite Unary positive +5 (positive 5) is ignored Logical-not (!): If the operand is blank or 0, the result of applying logical-not is 1, which means "true". Otherwise, the result is 0 (false). Bitwise-not (~): This inverts each bit of its operand. If the operand is a floating point value, it is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation Address (&): Dereference (*) -`\*Expression ` it retrieves the byte at that address as a number between 0 and 255 (0 is always retrieved if the address is 0; but any other invalid address must be avoided because it might crash the script). However, NumGet() is preferred

Multiply (\*): The result is an integer if both inputs are integers; otherwise, it is a floating point number.
True divide (/): Unlike EnvDiv, true division yields a floating point result even when both inputs are integers.
Floor divide (//): The double-slash operator uses high-performance integer division if the two inputs are integers. For example, 5//3 is 1 and 5//-3 is -1. If either of the inputs is in floating point format, floating point division is performed and the result is truncated to the nearest integer to the left
EnvDiv (/ =)- Sets a variable to itself divided by the given value. _Deprecated_: This command is not recommended for use in new scripts. Use Var := Var / Value or Var /= Value instead

EnvMult (_=) -Sets a variable to itself times the given value. Deprecated: This command is not recommended for use in new scripts. Use `Var := Var _ Value`or`Var \*= Value` instead.

Add (+)
EnvAdd (+=) -Sets a variable to the sum of itself plus the given value (can also add or subtract time from a date-time value). Synonymous with: var += value.
Subtract (-).
EnvSub (-=) Sets a variable to itself minus the given value (can also compare date-time values). Synonymous with: Var -= Value.

#### Bitwise:

Bitwise-and (`&`)
Bitwise-exclusive-or (`^`)
Bitwise-or (`|`).
Bit shift left (`<<`) and right (>>). Shift left (<<) is equivalent to multiplying Value1 by "2 to the Value2th power". Shift right (>>) is equivalent to dividing Value1 by "2 to the Value2th power" and rounding the result to the nearest integer leftward on the number line; for example, -3>>1 is -2.

#### Concatenate

(`.`) The period (dot) operator is used to combine two items into a single string (there must be at least one space on each side of the period). (See Below)
Example (expression method): `Var := "The color is " . FoundColor`
Example (traditional method): `Var = The color is %FoundColor%`

~= [v1.0.90+]: Shorthand for RegExMatch. For example, "`abc123" ~= "\d`" sets ErrorLevel to 0 and yields 4 (the position of the first numeric character). Earlier versions acted differently.

Greater (>), less (<), greater-or-equal (`>`=), and less-or-equal (<=).
Equal (=), case-sensitive-equal (`==`), and not-equal (`<>` or `!=`).
`NOT` Logical-NOT.

`AND` or `&&` logical-AND
`OR` or `||` - logical-OR
`?:` Ternary operator -This operator is a shorthand replacement for the if-else statement. It evaluates the condition on its left side to determine which of its two branches should become its final result. For example, `var := x>y ? 2 : 3` stores 2 in Var if x is greater than y; otherwise it stores 3. To enhance performance, only the winning branch is evaluated (see short-circuit evaluation in help).

Assignment
`:=`

`+=` , `-=` , `\*=` , /= , `//=` , `.=` , `|=` ,`&=` , `^=` , `>>=` , `<<=`

, Comma (multi-statement) Commas may be used to write multiple sub-expressions on a single line. This is most commonly used to group together multiple assignments or function calls. For example: x:=1, y+=2, ++index, MyFunc().
Note: A line that begins with a comma (or any other operator) is automatically appended to the line above it. See also: comma performance.

#### Special Characters

A_Space This variable contains a single space character. See AutoTrim for details.
A_Tab This variable contains a single tab character. See AutoTrim for details.

#### Script Properties

- **1, 2, 3, etc.** These variables are automatically created whenever a script is launched with command line parameters. They can be changed and referenced just like normal variable names (for example: %1%), but cannot be referenced directly in an expression. The variable %0% contains the number of parameters passed (0 if none). For details, see the command line parameters.
- `A_Args`Read/write: Contains an array of command line parameters. For details, see Passing Command Line Parameters to a Script.
- `A_WorkingDir` The script's current working directory, which is where files will be accessed by default. The final backslash is not included unless it is the root directory. Two examples: C:\ and C:\My Documents. Use SetWorkingDir to change the working directory.
- `A_ScriptDir` The full path of the directory where the current script is located. The final backslash is omitted (even for root directories).
- `A_ScriptName` The file name of the current script, without its path, e.g. MyScript.ahk.
- `A_ScriptFullPath` The combination of the above two variables to give the complete file specification of the script, e.g. C:\My Documents\My Script.ahk
- `A_ScriptHwnd` The unique ID (HWND/handle) of the script's hidden main window.
- `A_LineNumber` The number of the currently executing line within the script (or one of its #Include files). This line number will match the one shown by ListLines; it can be useful for error reporting such as this example: MsgBox Could not write to log file (line number %A_LineNumber%). Since a compiled script has merged all its #Include files into one big script, its line numbering may be different than when it is run in non-compiled mode.
- `A_LineFile` The full path and name of the file to which A_LineNumber belongs, which will be the same as A_ScriptFullPath unless the line belongs to one of a non-compiled script's #Include files.
- `A_ThisFunc` The name of the user-defined function that is currently executing (blank if none); for example: MyFunction. See also: IsFunc()
- `A_ThisLabel` The name of the label (subroutine) that is currently executing (blank if none); for example: MyLabel. It is updated whenever the script executes Gosub/Return or Goto. It is also updated for automatically-called labels such as timers, GUI threads, menu items, hotkeys, hotstrings, OnClipboardChange (label), and OnExit. However, A_ThisLabel is not updated when execution "falls into" a label from above; when that happens, A_ThisLabel retains its previous value. See also: A_ThisHotkey and IsLabel()
- `A_AhkVersion` In versions prior to 1.0.22, this variable is blank. Otherwise, it contains the version of AutoHotkey that is running the script, such as 1.0.22. In the case of a compiled script, the version that was originally used to compile it is reported. The formatting of the version number allows a script to check whether A_AhkVersion is greater than some minimum version number with > or >= as in this example: if A_AhkVersion >= 1.0.25.07.
- `A_AhkPath` For non-compiled scripts: The full path and name of the EXE file that is actually running the current script. For example: C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe

#### For compiled scripts:

The same as the above except the AutoHotkey directory is discovered via the registry entry HKLM\SOFTWARE\AutoHotkey\InstallDir. If there is no such entry, A_AhkPath is blank.

- `A_IsUnicode` Contains 1 if strings are Unicode (16-bit) and an empty string (which is considered false) if strings are ANSI (8-bit). The format of strings depends on the version of AutoHotkey.exe which is used to run the script, or if it is compiled, which bin file was used to compile it.
- `A_IsCompiled` Contains 1 if the script is running as a compiled EXE and an empty string (which is considered false) if it is not.
- `A_ExitReason` The most recent reason the script was asked to terminate. This variable is blank unless the script has an OnExit subroutine and that subroutine is currently running or has been called at least once by an exit attempt. See OnExit for details.

#### Date and Time

- `A_YYYY` Current 4-digit year (e.g. 2004). Synonymous with A_Year. Note: To retrieve a formatted time or date appropriate for your locale and language, use FormatTime, OutputVar (time and long date) or FormatTime, OutputVar,, LongDate (retrieves long-format date).\
- `A_Year` (above)
- `A_MM` | `A_Mon` Current 2-digit month (01-12). Synonymous with
- `A_DD` | `A_MDay` Current 2-digit day of the month (01-31). Synonymous with
- `A_MMMM` Current month's full name in the current user's language, e.g. July
- `A_MMM` Current month's abbreviation in the current user's language, e.g. Jul
- `A_DDDD` Current day of the week's full name in the current user's language, e.g. Sunday
- `A_DDD` Current day of the week's abbreviation in the current user's language, e.g. Sun
- `A_WDay` Current 1-digit day of the week (1-7). 1 is Sunday in all locales.
- `A_YDay` Current day of the year (1-366). The value is not zero-padded, e.g. 9 is retrieved, not 009. To retrieve a zero-padded value, use the following: FormatTime, OutputVar,, YDay0.
- `A_YWeek` Current year and week number (e.g. 200453) according to ISO 8601. To separate the year from the week, use StringLeft, Year, A_YWeek, 4 and StringRight, Week, A_YWeek, 2. Precise definition of A_YWeek: If the week containing January 1st has four or more days in the new year, it is considered week 1. Otherwise, it is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.
- `A_Hour` Current 2-digit hour (00-23) in 24-hour time (for example, 17 is 5pm). To retrieve 12-hour time as well as an AM/PM indicator, follow this example: FormatTime, OutputVar, , h:mm:ss tt
- `A_Min`Current 2-digit minute (00-59).
- `A_Sec` Current 2-digit second (00-59).
- `A_MSec` Current 3-digit millisecond (000-999). To remove the leading zeros, follow this example: Milliseconds := A_MSec + 0.
- `A_Now`The current local time in YYYYMMDDHH24MISS format.
- `A_NowUTC` The current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in YYYYMMDDHH24MISS format. UTC is essentially the same as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
- `A_TickCount`The number of milliseconds since the computer was rebooted. By storing A_TickCount in a variable, elapsed time can later be measured by subtracting that variable from the latest A_TickCount value.

Note: Date and time math can be performed with EnvAdd and EnvSub. Also, FormatTime can format the date and/or time according to your locale or preferences.

For example:

```
StartTime := A_TickCount
Sleep, 1000
ElapsedTime := A_TickCount - StartTime
MsgBox, %ElapsedTime% milliseconds have elapsed.
```

If you need more precision than A_TickCount's 10ms, use QueryPerformanceCounter().

#### Script Settings

- `A_IsSuspended` Contains 1 if the script is suspended and 0 otherwise.
- `A_IsPaused`[v1.0.48+] Contains 1 if the thread immediately underneath the current thread is paused. Otherwise it contains 0.
- `A_IsCritical`[v1.0.48+] Contains 0 if Critical is off for the current thread. Otherwise it contains an integer greater than zero, namely the message-check frequency being used by Critical. Since Critical 0 turns off critical, the current state of Critical can be saved and restored via Old_IsCritical := A_IsCritical followed later by Critical %Old_IsCritical%.
- `A_BatchLines` (synonymous with A_NumBatchLines) The current value as set by SetBatchLines. Examples: 200 or 10ms (depending on format).
- `A_ListLines`
- [v1.1.28+] Contains 1 if ListLines is enabled. Otherwise it contains 0.
- `A_TitleMatchMode` The current mode set by SetTitleMatchMode: 1, 2, 3, or RegEx.
- `A_TitleMatchModeSpeed` The current match speed (fast or slow) set by SetTitleMatchMode.
- `A_DetectHiddenWindows` The current mode (On or Off) set by DetectHiddenWindows.
- `A_DetectHiddenText` The current mode (On or Off) set by DetectHiddenText.
- `A_AutoTrim` The current mode (On or Off) set by AutoTrim.
- `A_StringCaseSense` The current mode (On, Off, or Locale) set by StringCaseSense.
- `A_FileEncoding` [v1.0.90+]: Contains the default encoding for various commands; see FileEncoding.
- `A_FormatInteger` The current integer format (H or D) set by SetFormat. [v1.0.90+]: This may also contain lower-case h.
- `A_FormatFloat` The current floating point number format set by SetFormat.
- `A_SendMode` [v1.1.23+]: The current mode (Event, Input, Play or InputThenPlay) set by SendMode.
- `A_SendLevel` [v1.1.23+]: The current SendLevel setting (an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive).
- `A_StoreCapsLockMode` [v1.1.23+]: The current mode (On or Off) set by SetStoreCapsLockMode.
- `A_KeyDelay`
- `A_KeyDuration` The current delay or duration set by SetKeyDelay (always decimal, not hex). A_KeyDuration requires [v1.1.23+].
- `A_KeyDelayPlay`
- `A_KeyDurationPlay` The current delay or duration set by SetKeyDelay for the SendPlay mode (always decimal, not hex). Requires [v1.1.23+].
- `A_WinDelay` The current delay set by SetWinDelay (always decimal, not hex).
- `A_ControlDelay` The current delay set by SetControlDelay (always decimal, not hex).
- `A_MouseDelay`
- `A_MouseDelayPlay` The current delay set by SetMouseDelay (always decimal, not hex). A_MouseDelay is for the traditional SendEvent mode, whereas A_MouseDelayPlay is for SendPlay. A_MouseDelayPlay requires [v1.1.23+].
- `A_DefaultMouseSpeed` The current speed set by SetDefaultMouseSpeed (always decimal, not hex).
- `A_CoordModeToolTip`
- `A_CoordModePixel`
- `A_CoordModeMouse`
- `A_CoordModeCaret`
- `A_CoordModeMenu` [v1.1.23+]: The current mode (Window, Client or Screen) set by CoordMode.
- `A_RegView` [v1.1.08+]: The current registry view as set by SetRegView.
- `A_IconHidden` Contains 1 if the tray icon is currently hidden or 0 otherwise. The icon can be hidden via #NoTrayIcon or the Menu command.
- `A_IconTip` Blank unless a custom tooltip for the tray icon has been specified via Menu, Tray, Tip -- in which case it's the text of the tip.
- `A_IconFile` Blank unless a custom tray icon has been specified via Menu, tray, icon -- in which case it's the full path and name of the icon's file.
- `A_IconNumber` Blank if A_IconFile is blank. Otherwise, it's the number of the icon in A_IconFile (typically 1).

#### User Idle Time

- `A_TimeIdle` The number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system last received keyboard, mouse, or other input. This is useful for determining whether the user is away. Physical input from the user as well as artificial input generated by any program or script (such as the Send or MouseMove commands) will reset this value back to zero. Since this value tends to increase by increments of 10, do not check whether it is equal to another value. Instead, check whether it is greater or less than another value. For example: IfGreater, A_TimeIdle, 600000, MsgBox, The last keyboard or mouse activity was at least 10 minutes ago.
- `A_TimeIdlePhysical` Similar to above but ignores artificial keystrokes and/or mouse clicks whenever the corresponding hook (keyboard or mouse) is installed; that is, it responds only to physical events. (This prevents simulated keystrokes and mouse clicks from falsely indicating that a user is present.) If neither hook is installed, this variable is equivalent to A_TimeIdle. If only one hook is installed, only its type of physical input affects `A_TimeIdlePhysical` (the other/non-installed hook's input, both physical and artificial, has no effect).
- `A_TimeIdleKeyboard` [v1.1.28+] If the keyboard hook is installed, this is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system last received physical keyboard input. Otherwise, this variable is equivalent to A_TimeIdle.
- `A_TimeIdleMouse` [v1.1.28+] If the mouse hook is installed, this is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system last received physical mouse input. Otherwise, this variable is equivalent to A_TimeIdle.

#### GUI Windows and Menu Bars

- `A_DefaultGui` [v1.1.23+] The name or number of the current thread's default GUI.
- `A_DefaultListView` [v1.1.23+] The variable name or HWND of the ListView control upon which the ListView functions operate. If the default GUI lacks a ListView, this variable is blank.
- `A_DefaultTreeView` [v1.1.23+] The variable name or HWND of the TreeView control upon which the TreeView functions operate. If the default GUI lacks a TreeView, this variable is blank.
- `A_Gui` The name or number of the GUI that launched the current thread. This variable is blank unless a Gui control, menu bar item, or event such as GuiClose/GuiEscape launched the current thread.
- `A_GuiControl` The name of the variable associated with the GUI control that launched the current thread. If that control lacks an associated variable, A_GuiControl instead contains the first 63 characters of the control's text/caption (this is most often used to avoid giving each button a variable name). A_GuiControl is blank whenever: 1) A_Gui is blank; 2) a GUI menu bar item or event such as GuiClose/GuiEscape launched the current thread; 3) the control lacks an associated variable and has no caption; or 4) The control that originally launched the current thread no longer exists (perhaps due to Gui Destroy).
- `A_GuiWidth`
- `A_GuiHeight` These contain the GUI window's width and height when referenced in a GuiSize subroutine. They apply to the window's client area, which is the area excluding title bar, menu bar, and borders. [v1.1.11+]: These values are affected by DPI scaling.
- `A_GuiX`
- `A_GuiY` These contain the X and Y coordinates for _GuiContextMenu_ and _GuiDropFiles_ events. Coordinates are relative to the upper-left corner of the window. [v1.1.11+]: These values are affected by DPI scaling.
- `A_GuiEvent` | `A_GuiControlEvent` The type of event that launched the current thread. If the thread was not launched via GUI action, this variable is blank. Otherwise, it contains one of the following strings:
  - **Normal**: The event was triggered by a single left-click or via keystrokes (arrow keys, TAB key, space bar, underlined shortcut key, etc.). This value is also used for menu bar items and the special events such as GuiClose and GuiEscape.
  - **DoubleClick**: The event was triggered by a double-click. Note: The first click of the click-pair will still cause a Normal event to be received first. In other words, the subroutine will be launched twice: once for the first click and again for the second.
  - **RightClick**: Occurs only for _GuiContextMenu_, _ListViews_, and _TreeViews_.

#### Context-sensitive values:

For details see _GuiContextMenu_, _GuiDropFiles_, _Slider_, _MonthCal_, _ListView_, and _TreeView_.

- `A_EventInfo`Contains additional information about the following events:
  - The OnClipboardChange label
  - Mouse wheel hotkeys (WheelDown/Up/Left/Right)
  - OnMessage()
  - RegisterCallback()
  - Regular Expression Callouts
  - GUI events, namely _GuiContextMenu_, _GuiDropFiles_, _ListBox_, _ListView_, _TreeView_, and _StatusBar_. If there is no additional information for an event, A_EventInfo contains 0.

Note: Unlike variables such as A_ThisHotkey, each thread retains its own value for A_Gui, A_GuiControl, A_GuiX/Y, A_GuiEvent, and A_EventInfo. Therefore, if a thread is interrupted by another, upon being resumed it will still see its original/correct values in these variables.

#### Hotkeys, Hotstrings, and Custom Menu Items

- `A_ThisMenuItem` The name of the most recently selected custom menu item (blank if none).
- `A_ThisMenu` The name of the menu from which A_ThisMenuItem was selected.
- `A_ThisMenuItemPos` A number indicating the current position of A_ThisMenuItem within A_ThisMenu. The first item in the menu is 1, the second is 2, and so on. Menu separator lines are counted. This variable is blank if - `A_ThisMenuItem` is blank or no longer exists within A_ThisMenu. It is also blank if A_ThisMenu itself no longer exists.
- `A_ThisHotkey` The most recently executed hotkey or non-auto-replace hotstring (blank if none), e.g. #z. This value will change if the current thread is interrupted by another hotkey, so be sure to copy it into another variable immediately if you need the original value for later use in a subroutine.

When a hotkey is first created -- either by the Hotkey command or a double-colon label in the script -- its key name and the ordering of its modifier symbols becomes the permanent name of that hotkey, shared by all variants of the hotkey.

See also: `A_ThisLabel`

- `A_PriorHotkey` Same as above except for the previous hotkey. It will be blank if none.
- `A_PriorKey` [v1.1.01+]: The name of the last key which was pressed prior to the most recent key-press or key-release, or blank if no applicable key-press can be found in the key history. All input generated by AutoHotkey scripts is excluded. For this variable to be of use, the keyboard or mouse hook must be installed and key history must be enabled.
- `A_TimeSinceThisHotkey` The number of milliseconds that have elapsed since A_ThisHotkey was pressed. It will be -1 whenever A_ThisHotkey is blank.
- `A_TimeSincePriorHotkey` The number of milliseconds that have elapsed since A_PriorHotkey was pressed. It will be -1 whenever A_PriorHotkey is blank.
- `A_EndChar` The ending character that was pressed by the user to trigger the most recent non-auto-replace hotstring. If no ending character was required (due to the \* option), this variable will be blank.

#### Operating System and User Info

- `ComSpec` [v1.0.43.08+] | `A_ComSpec` [v1.1.28+] Contains the same string as the environment's `ComSpec` variable (e.g. C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe). Often used with Run/RunWait.
- `A_Temp` [v1.0.43.09+] The full path and name of the folder designated to hold temporary files (e.g. C:\DOCUME~1\<UserName>\LOCALS~1\Temp). It is retrieved from one of the following locations (in order): 1) the environment variables TMP, TEMP, or USERPROFILE; 2) the Windows directory.
- `A_OSType` The type of operating system being run. Since AutoHotkey 1.1 only supports NT-based operating systems, this is always WIN32_NT. Older versions of AutoHotkey return WIN32_WINDOWS when run on Windows 95/98/ME.
- `A_OSVersion` One of the following strings, if appropriate: WIN_7 [requires v1.0.90+], WIN_8 [requires v1.1.08+], WIN_8.1 [requires v1.1.15+], WIN_VISTA, WIN_2003, WIN_XP, WIN_2000.

Applying compatibility settings in the AutoHotkey executable or compiled script's properties causes the OS to report a different version number, which is reflected by A_OSVersion.

[v1.1.20+]: If the OS version is not recognized as one of those listed above, a string in the format "major.minor.build" is returned. For example, 10.0.14393 is Windows 10 build 14393, also known as version 1607.
; This example is obsolete as these operating systems are no longer supported.

```
if A_OSVersion in WIN_NT4,WIN_95,WIN_98,WIN_ME ; Note: No spaces around commas.
{
    MsgBox This script requires Windows 2000/XP or later.
    ExitApp
}
```

- `A_Is64bitOS` [v1.1.08+]: Contains 1 (true) if the OS is 64-bit or 0 (false) if it is 32-bit.
- `A_PtrSize` [v1.0.90+]: Contains the size of a pointer, in bytes. This is either 4 (32-bit) or 8 (64-bit), depending on what type of executable (EXE) is running the script.
- `A_Language` The system's default language, which is one of these 4-digit codes.
- `A_ComputerName` The name of the computer as seen on the network.
- `A_UserName` The logon name of the user who launched this script.
- `A_WinDir` The Windows directory. For example: C:\Windows
- `A_ProgramFiles` | `ProgramFiles` The Program Files directory (e.g. C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)). This is usually the same as the ProgramFiles environment variable.

On 64-bit systems (and not 32-bit systems), the following applies:
- If the executable (EXE) that is running the script is 32-bit, A_ProgramFiles returns the path of the "Program Files (x86)" directory.
- For 32-bit processes, the ProgramW6432 environment variable contains the path of the 64-bit Program Files directory. On Windows 7 and later, it is also set for 64-bit processes.
- The ProgramFiles(x86) environment variable contains the path of the 32-bit Program Files directory.

_**[v1.0.43.08+]: The A\_ prefix may be omitted, which helps ease the transition to `#NoEnv`.**_

- `A_AppData` [v1.0.43.09+] The full path and name of the folder containing the current user's application-specific data. For example: C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data
- `A_AppDataCommon` [v1.0.43.09+] The full path and name of the folder containing the all-users application-specific data.
- `A_Desktop` The full path and name of the folder containing the current user's desktop files.
- `A_DesktopCommon` The full path and name of the folder containing the all-users desktop files.
- `A_StartMenu` The full path and name of the current user's Start Menu folder.
- `A_StartMenuCommon` The full path and name of the all-users Start Menu folder.
- `A_Programs` The full path and name of the Programs folder in the current user's Start Menu.
- `A_ProgramsCommon` The full path and name of the Programs folder in the all-users Start Menu.
- `A_Startup` The full path and name of the Startup folder in the current user's Start Menu.
- `A_StartupCommon` The full path and name of the Startup folder in the all-users Start Menu.
- `A_MyDocuments` The full path and name of the current user's "My Documents" folder. Unlike most of the similar variables, if the folder is the root of a drive, the final backslash is not included. For example, it would contain M: rather than M:\
- `A_IsAdmin`If the current user has admin rights, this variable contains 1. Otherwise, it contains 0.

NOTE:_**To have the script restart itself as admin (or show a prompt to the user requesting admin), use Run \*RunAs. However, note that running the script as admin causes all programs launched by the script to also run as admin. For a possible alternative, see the FAQ.**_

- `A_ScreenWidth`
- `A_ScreenHeight`

The width and height of the primary monitor, in pixels (e.g. 1024 and 768).

To discover the dimensions of other monitors in a multi-monitor system, use SysGet.

To instead discover the width and height of the entire desktop (even if it spans multiple monitors), use the following example:

```ahk
SysGet, VirtualWidth, 78
SysGet, VirtualHeight, 79
```

In addition, use SysGet to discover the work area of a monitor, which can be smaller than the monitor's total area because the taskbar and other registered desktop toolbars are excluded.

- `A_ScreenDPI` [v1.1.11+] Number of pixels per logical inch along the screen width. In a system with multiple display monitors, this value is the same for all monitors. On most systems this is 96; it depends on the system's text size (DPI) setting. See also Gui -DPIScale.
- `A_IPAddress1` through 4 The IP addresses of the first 4 network adapters in the computer.

#### Misc.

`A_Cursor`
The type of mouse cursor currently being displayed. It will be one of the following words: AppStarting, Arrow, Cross, Help, IBeam, Icon, No, Size, SizeAll, SizeNESW, SizeNS, SizeNWSE, SizeWE, UpArrow, Wait, Unknown. The acronyms used with the size-type cursors are compass directions, e.g. NESW = NorthEast+SouthWest. The hand-shaped cursors (pointing and grabbing) are classified as Unknown.

`A_CaretX`

`A_CaretY`
The current X and Y coordinates of the caret (text insertion point). The coordinates are relative to the active window unless CoordMode is used to make them relative to the entire screen. If there is no active window or the caret position cannot be determined, these variables are blank.

The following script allows you to move the caret around to see its current position displayed in an auto-update tooltip. Note that some windows (e.g. certain versions of MS Word) report the same caret position regardless of its actual position.

```
#Persistent
SetTimer, WatchCaret, 100
return
WatchCaret:
ToolTip, X%A_CaretX% Y%A_CaretY%, A_CaretX, A_CaretY - 20
return
```

#### Clipboard

- `Clipboard Read`/ `Clipboard Write`: The contents of the OS's clipboard, which can be read or written to. See the Clipboard section.
- `ClipboardAll` The entire contents of the clipboard (such as formatting and text). See ClipboardAll.
- `ErrorLevel Read/write`: See ErrorLevel.
- `A_LastError` The result from the OS's GetLastError() function or the last COM object invocation. For details, see DllCall() and Run/RunWait.
- `True` & `False` Contain 1 and 0. They can be used to make a script more readable. See Boolean Values for details.

#### Loop

- `A_Index` This is the number of the current loop iteration (a 64-bit integer). For example, the first time the script executes the body of a loop, this variable will contain the number 1. For details see Loop or While-loop.
- `A_LoopFileName`, etc. This and other related variables are valid only inside a file-loop.
- `A_LoopRegName`, etc. This and other related variables are valid only inside a registry-loop.
- `A_LoopReadLine` See file-reading loop.
- `A_LoopField` See parsing loop.

### Objects

x[y] , [a, b, c][v1.0.90+]: Member access. Get or set a value or call a method of object x, where y is a parameter list (typically an array index or key) or an expression which returns a method name.

                    [v1.0.97+]: Array literal. If the open-bracket is not preceded by a value (or a sub-expression which yields a value), it is interpreted as the beginning of an array literal. For example, [a, b, c] is equivalent to Array(a, b, c) (a, b and c are variables).See array syntax and object syntax for more details.

{a: b, c: d} = Object literal. Create an object or associative array. For example, x := {a: b} is equivalent to x := Object("a", b) or x := Object(), x.a := b. See Associative Arrays for details.

### Simple Arrays

Create an array: `Array := [Item1, Item2, ..., ItemN]` or `Array := Array(Item1, Item2, ..., ItemN)`

Retrieve an item: `Value := Array[Index]`

Assign an item: `Array[Index] := Value`

Insert one or more items at a given index: `Array.InsertAt(Index, Value, Value2, ...)`

Append one or more items: `Array.Push(Value, Value2, ...)`

Remove an item: `RemovedValue := Array.RemoveAt(Index)`

Remove the last item: `RemovedValue := Array.Pop()`

Also `Array.MinIndex(`) `Array.MaxIndex()` == `Array.Length()`

### Associative Arrays

An associative array is an object which contains a collection of unique keys and a collection of values, where each key is associated with one value. Keys can be strings, integers or objects, while values can be of any type. An associative array can be created as follows: `Array := {KeyA: ValueA, KeyB: ValueB, ..., KeyZ: ValueZ}` OR `Array := Object("KeyA", ValueA, "KeyB", ValueB, ..., "KeyZ", ValueZ)`

Using the **{key:value}** notation, quote marks are optional for keys which consist only of word characters. Any expression can be used as a key, but to use a variable as a key, it must be enclosed in parentheses. For example, `{(KeyVar): Value}` and `{GetKey(): Value}` are both valid.

Retrieve an item: `Value := Array[Key]`

Assign an item: `Array[Key] := Value`

Remove an item: `RemovedValue := Array.Delete(Key)`

Enumerating items:

```AHK
array := {ten: 10, twenty: 20, thirty: 30}
For key, value in array
    MsgBox %key% = %value%
```

### Lists (Finally!)

Very difficult to find this documented. List syntax is separated by |

But...its not a built in function, looks like its really an array

```ahk
listName =  = Ben|Ellie|Ian|Will

MsgBox % List(listName,1)
MsgBox % List(listName,2)
MsgBox % List(listName,3)
MsgBox % List(listName,4)


;*************FUNCTION***********
List(listName,integer)
{
 Loop, parse, listName, |
 {
  If (integer = A_Index) {
   returnValue := A_LoopField
  }
 }
 return returnValue
}
```

## Expressions

The == operator behaves identically to = except when either of the inputs is not a number, in which case == is always case sensitive and = is always case insensitive (the method of insensitivity depends on StringCaseSense). By contrast, <> and != obey StringCaseSense.

## Specific Tips and Tricks

### Run as Admin

NOTE:_**To have the script restart itself as admin (or show a prompt to the user requesting admin), use Run \*RunAs. However, note that running the script as admin causes all programs launched by the script to also run as admin. For a possible alternative, see the FAQ.**_

or this:

```ahk
; check if running as administrator, then if not, try and restart as admin,

full_command_line := DllCall("GetCommandLine", "str")

if not (A_IsAdmin or RegExMatch(full_command_line, " /restart(?!\S)"))
{
    try
    {
        if A_IsCompiled
            Run *RunAs "%A_ScriptFullPath%" /restart
        else
            Run *RunAs "%A_AhkPath%" /restart "%A_ScriptFullPath%"
    }
    ExitApp, 1
}


;Debug Remove
MsgBox A_IsAdmin: %A_IsAdmin%`nCommand line: %full_command_line%
```
