## Setup

Linux needs 

sudo apt-get install linux-libc-dev gcc-multilib cmake cmake-doc gcc clang

build-essential 

needed to get the new cmake a few times.

/https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference#_args
This allows mapping of the compile-time paths for source to local source locations. 

It is an object of key/value pairs and will resolve the first string-matched path. (example: 
        
        "sourceFileMap": { "/mnt/c": "c:\\" } 
        
  will map any path returned by the debugger that begins with `/mnt/c` and convert it to `c:\\`. You can have multiple mappings in the object but they will be handled in the order provided.)

Unclear where to put it though...



Variables defined with `=` are recursively expanded variables. Variables defined with `:=` or `::=` are simply expanded variables; these definitions can contain variable references which will be expanded before the definition is made. See The Two Flavors of Variables.

The shell assignment operator `!=` can be used to execute a shell script and set a variable to its output. This operator first evaluates the right-hand side, then passes that result to the shell for execution. If the result of the execution ends in a newline, that one newline is removed; all other newlines are replaced by spaces. The resulting string is then placed into the named recursively-expanded variable. 

Must be `cppvsdbg` when using the Visual Studio Windows debugger, and `cppdbg` when using GDB or LLDB. This is automatically set to the correct value when the launch.json file is created

[GCC Compiler Docs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/)

[GCC Compiler Options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-7.5.0/gcc/Option-Summary.html#Option-Summary)

Some Common Ones- [ From here- Which are mostly Warning Options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-7.5.0/gcc/Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options)


-Wpedantic - Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any -std option used.


`-Wall`
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros. This also enables some language-specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.


-Wall turns on the following warning flags:

      -Waddress   
      -Warray-bounds=1 (only with -O2)  
      -Wbool-compare  
      -Wbool-operation  
      -Wc++11-compat  -Wc++14-compat  
      -Wchar-subscripts  
      -Wcomment  
      -Wduplicate-decl-specifier (C and Objective-C only) 
      -Wenum-compare (in C/ObjC; this is on by default in C++) 
      -Wformat   
      -Wint-in-bool-context  
      -Wimplicit (C and Objective-C only) 
      -Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only) 
      -Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only) 
      -Winit-self (only for C++) 
      -Wlogical-not-parentheses 
      -Wmain (only for C/ObjC and unless -ffreestanding)  
      -Wmaybe-uninitialized 
      -Wmemset-elt-size 
      -Wmemset-transposed-args 
      -Wmisleading-indentation (only for C/C++) 
      -Wmissing-braces (only for C/ObjC) 
      -Wnarrowing (only for C++)  
      -Wnonnull  
      -Wnonnull-compare  
      -Wopenmp-simd 
      -Wparentheses  
      -Wpointer-sign  
      -Wreorder   
      -Wreturn-type  
      -Wsequence-point  
      -Wsign-compare (only in C++)  
      -Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess 
      -Wstrict-aliasing  
      -Wstrict-overflow=1  
      -Wswitch  
      -Wtautological-compare  
      -Wtrigraphs  
      -Wuninitialized  
      -Wunknown-pragmas  
      -Wunused-function  
      -Wunused-label     
      -Wunused-value     
      -Wunused-variable  
      -Wvolatile-register-var 


`-Wextra`
This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall. (This option used to be called -W. The older name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

    -Wclobbered  
    -Wempty-body  
    -Wignored-qualifiers 
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 
    -Wmissing-field-initializers  
    -Wmissing-parameter-type (C only)  
    -Wold-style-declaration (C only)  
    -Woverride-init  
    -Wsign-compare (C only) 
    -Wtype-limits  
    -Wuninitialized  
    -Wshift-negative-value (in C++03 and in C99 and newer)  
    -Wunused-parameter (only with -Wunused or -Wall) 
    -Wunused-but-set-parameter (only with -Wunused or -Wall)  


Can be suppressed with effort- 

C++17 provides a standard way to suppress the -Wimplicit-fallthrough warning using [[fallthrough]];

Since there are occasions where a switch case fall through is desirable, GCC provides an attribute, __attribute__ ((fallthrough)), that is to be used along with a null statement to suppress this warning that would normally occur:

### Make Implicit Variables

[Implicit Vars](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html#Implicit-Variables)

- `AR` - Archive-maintaining program; default `ar`.

- `TANGLE` - Program to translate Web into Pascal; default `tangle`.
- `CTANGLE` - Program to translate C Web into C; default `ctangle`.
- `RM` - Command to remove a file; default 'rm -f'. 

Here is a table of variables whose values are additional arguments for the programs above. The default values for all of these is the empty string, unless otherwise noted.

- `ARFLAGS` - Flags to give the archive-maintaining program; default `rv`.
- `ASFLAGS` - Extra flags to give to the assembler (when explicitly invoked on a `.s` or `.S` file).
- `CFLAGS` - Extra flags to give to the C compiler.
- `CXXFLAGS` - Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler.
- `COFLAGS` - Extra flags to give to the RCS co program.

- `GFLAGS` - Extra flags to give to the SCCS get program.
- `LDFLAGS` - Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker, `ld`, such as -L. Libraries (-lfoo) should be added to the LDLIBS variable instead.
- `LDLIBS` - Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker, `ld`. LOADLIBES is a deprecated (but still supported) alternative to LDLIBS. Non-library linker flags, such as -L, should go in the LDFLAGS variable.

## Important Vars


LDLIBS            = $(LIB)  Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker,  e.g. 'get-arg' '-lget_thread' 

LDFLAGS          = -L$(LIB_D)  Most significanly accepts the -L flag a linker Library Directory.


CPP (C Preprocessor) - CC/GCC/G++/C++ -> Linker (AR)

In addition to the options listed here,  there are a number of options to control searchpaths for include files documented inSection 3.15 [Directory Options], page 188.  Optionsto control preprocessor diagnostics are listed inSection 3.8 [Warning Options], page 59.

-Dname  Predefinenameas a macro, with definition  1 (e.g. true I tink)

`-pthread`  Define  additional  macros  required  for  using  the  POSIX  threads  library.   Youshould  use  this  option  consistently  for  both  compilation  and  linking.   Thisoption is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, andalso on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets

-HPrint the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal activities.Each name is indented to show how deep in the '#include' stack it is.  Precom-piled header files are also printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalidprecompiled header file is printed with '...x' and a valid one with '...!' .


- Linker Settings

-fuse-ld=bfdUse thebfdlinker instead of the default linker.

-fuse-ld=goldUse thegoldlinker instead of the default linker

!!! Note : The only difference between using an '-l' option and specifying a filename  is  that  '-l'  surroundslibrarywith  'lib'  and  '.a'  and  searches  severaldirectories.


Directories  specified  with  '-iquote'  apply  only  to  the  quote  form  of  thedirective,#include "file".Directories  specified  with  '-I',   '-isystem',or   '-idirafter'   apply   to   lookup   for   both   the#include "file"and#include <file>directives.You can specify any number or combination of these options on the commandline  to  search  for  header  files  in  several  directories.   The  lookup  order  is  asfollows:1.  For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the current fileis searched first.2.  For  the  quote  form  of  the  include  directive,  the  directories  specified  by'-iquote' options are searched in left-to-right order, as they appear on thecommand line.3.  Directories specified with '-I' options are scanned in left-to-right order.4.  Directories  specified  with  '-isystem'  options  are  scanned  in  left-to-rightorder.5.  Standard system directories are scanned.6.  Directories specified with '-idirafter' options are scanned in left-to-rightorder.
Chapter 3:  GCC Command Options189You can use '-I' to override a system header file, substituting your own ver-sion, since these directories are searched before the standard system header filedirectories.   However,  you  should  not  use  this  option  to  add  directories  thatcontain vendor-supplied system header files; use '-isystem' for that.The '-isystem' and '-idirafter' options also mark the directory as a systemdirectory,  so  that  it  gets  the  same  special  treatment  that  is  applied  to  thestandard system directories.If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with '-isystem',is  also  specified  with  '-I',  the  '-I'  option  is  ignored.   The  directory  is  stillsearched but as a system directory at its normal position in the system includechain.  This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers andthe  ordering  for  the#include_nextdirective  are  not  inadvertently  changed.If  you  really  need  to  change  the  search  order  for  system  directories,  use  the'-nostdinc' and/or '-isystem' options.-I-Split the include path.  This option has been deprecated.  Please use '-iquote'instead for '-I' directories before the '-I-' and remove th

Any  directories  specified  with  '-I'  options  before  '-I-'  are  searched  onlyfor  headers  requested  with#include "file";   they  are  not  searched  for#include <file>.  If additional directories are specified with '-I' options afterthe '-I-', those directories are searched for all '#include' directives

#### Synttax

        targets : prerequisites
                recipe
                …

        or like this:

        targets : prerequisites ; recipe
                recipe
                …

TARGET: REQUIREMENTS

### Automatic Variables



$? all prerequisites newer than target The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces between them. If the target does not exist, all prerequisites will be included. 
`$?` -The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target

`$^` The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them

$^ all prerequisites.The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them. For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used (see Archives). 

`$<` is the automatic variable that holds the name of the FIRST prerequisite and 

`$<` The name of the first prerequisite. 

`$@` is the name of whichever target caused the rule's recipe to be run.  It is the TARGET

`$@` is the automatic variable that holds the name of the target;

$@ The file name of the target of the rule. If the target is an archive member, then `$@` is the name of the archive file. In a pattern rule that has multiple targets (see Introduction to Pattern Rules), `$@` is the name of whichever target caused the rule's recipe to be run. 

`$%`
    The target member name, when the target is an archive member. 



`$*`- `` - The stem with which an implicit rule matches
`$+`This is like `$^`, but prerequisites listed more than once are duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile. 
`$|`The names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between them.


`$*`
[Automatic Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html)

### More Automatic Variables


``$(@D)``   The directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing slash removed. If the value of `$@` is dir/foo.o then `$(@D)` is dir. This value is . if `$@` does not contain a slash.
``$(@F)` `    The file-within-directory part of the file name of the target. If the value of `$@` is dir/foo.o then `$(@F)` is foo.o. `$(@F)` is equivalent to '$(notdir $@)'.
``$(*D)``$(*F)`` The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the stem; dir and foo in this example.
``$(%D)``$(%F)`` The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target archive member name. This makes sense only for archive member targets of the form archive(member) and is useful only when member may contain a directory name. (See Archive Members as Targets.)
``$(<D)``$(<F)`` The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the first prerequisite.
``$(^D)``$(^F)`` - Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites.
``$(+D)` `$(+F)`` - Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites, including multiple instances of duplicated prerequisites.
``$(?D)` `$(?F)`` - Lists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites that are newer than the target. 

In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so `$*` cannot be determined in that way. Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized suffix (see Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules), `$*` is set to the target name minus the suffix.


-fno-gnu-keywordsDo not recognizetypeofas a keyword, so that code can use this word as anidentifier.  You can use the keyword__typeof__instead.  This option is impliedby the strict ISO C++dialects:  ‘-ansi’, ‘-std=c++98’, ‘-std=c++11’, etc.

-fno-show-column

[Directory Search](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory-Search)

### Make Functions:



#### eval Function

The eval function is very special: it allows you to define new makefile constructs that are not constant; which are the result of evaluating other variables and functions. The argument to the eval function is expanded, then the results of that expansion are parsed as makefile syntax. The expanded results can define new make variables, targets, implicit or explicit rules, etc. 


```sh
PROGRAMS    = server client

server_OBJS = server.o server_priv.o server_access.o
server_LIBS = priv protocol

client_OBJS = client.o client_api.o client_mem.o
client_LIBS = protocol

# Everything after this is generic
.PHONY: all
all: $(PROGRAMS)

define PROGRAM_template =
 $(1): $$($(1)_OBJS) $$($(1)_LIBS:%=-l%)
 ALL_OBJS   += $$($(1)_OBJS)
endef

$(foreach prog,$(PROGRAMS),$(eval $(call PROGRAM_template,$(prog))))

$(PROGRAMS):
        $(LINK.o) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $@

clean:
        rm -f $(ALL_OBJS) $(PROGRAMS)
```

####  origin Function

The `origin` function is unlike most other functions in that it does not operate on the values of variables; it tells you something about a variable. Specifically, it tells you where it came from.

The syntax of the origin function is:

`$(origin variable)`


- **undefined** - if variable was never defined.
- **default** - if variable has a default definition, as is usual with CC and so on. See Variables Used by Implicit Rules. Note that if you have redefined a default variable, the origin function will return the origin of the later definition.
- **environment** - if variable was inherited from the environment provided to make.
- **environment override** - if variable was inherited from the environment provided to make, and is overriding a setting for variable in the makefile as a result of the `-e` option (see [Summary of Options).](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary)
- **file** - if variable was defined in a makefile.
- **command line** - if variable was defined on the command line.
- **override** - if variable was defined with an override directive in a makefile (see [The override Directive).](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Override-Directive)
- **automatic** - if variable is an automatic variable defined for the execution of the recipe for each rule (see [Automatic Variables).](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables) 

#### flavor Function

The flavor function, like the origin function, does not operate on the values of variables but rather it tells you something about a variable. Specifically, it tells you the flavor of a variable (see The Two Flavors of Variables).

The syntax of the flavor function is: And will return one of the three:

`$(flavor variable)`

- **undefined** - if variable was never defined.
- **recursive** - if variable is a recursively expanded variable.
- **simple** - if variable is a simply expanded variable.

Simple assigned using `:=` or `::=` and means you cant expand a var within a var.  Recursive is just `=` and lets you.

#### shell Function

The shell function is unlike any other function other than the wildcard function (see The Function wildcard) in that it communicates with the world outside of make.

The shell function performs the same function that backquotes (```) perform in most shells: it does command expansion. This means that it takes as an argument a shell command and evaluates to the output of the command. The only processing make does on the result is to convert each newline (or carriage-return / newline pair) to a single space. If there is a trailing (carriage-return and) newline it will simply be removed. 

After the shell function or `!=` assignment operator is used, its exit status is placed in the .SHELLSTATUS variable.

Here are some examples of the use of the shell function:

        contents := $(shell cat foo)

sets contents to the contents of the file foo, with a space (rather than a newline) separating each line.

        files := $(shell echo *.c)

## 'Standard' Targets


- **all** - Make all the top-level targets the makefile knows about.
- **clean** - Delete all files that are normally created by running make.
- **mostlyclean**, **distclean**, **realclean** - Like `clean`, but may refrain from deleting a few files that people normally don't want to recompile. For example, the `mostlyclean` target for GCC does not delete libgcc.a, because recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
- **clobber** - Any of these targets might be defined to delete more files than `clean` does. For example, this would delete configuration files or links that you would normally create as preparation for compilation, even if the makefile itself cannot create these files.
- **install** - Copy the executable file into a directory that users typically search for commands; copy any auxiliary files that the executable uses into the directories where it will look for them.
- **print** - Print listings of the source files that have changed.
- **tar** - Create a tar file of the source files.
- **shar** - Create a shell archive (shar file) of the source files.
- **dist** - Create a distribution file of the source files. This might be a tar file, or a shar file, or a compressed version of one of the above, or even more than one of the above.
- **TAGS** - Update a tags table for this program.
check
- **test** - Perform self tests on the program this makefile builds. 

## Modifiers to Make

The makefile tells make how to tell whether a target is up to date, and how to update each target. But updating the targets is not always what you want. Certain options specify other activities for make.

        -B, --always-make                                 						Unconditionally make all targets.
        -C DIRECTORY, --directory=DIRECTORY 			 Change to DIRECTORY before doing anything.
        -d                          														Print lots of debugging information.
        --debug[=FLAGS]             											Print various types of debugging information.
        -e, --environment-overrides 										  Environment variables override makefiles.
        -E STRING, --eval=STRING    									Evaluate STRING as a makefile statement.
        -f FILE, --file=FILE, --makefile=FILE      Read FILE as a makefile.
        -i, --ignore-errors         Ignore errors from recipes.
        -I DIRECTORY, --include-dir=DIRECTORY   Search DIRECTORY for included makefiles.
        -j [N], --jobs[=N]          Allow N jobs at once; infinite jobs with no arg.
        -k, --keep-going            Keep going when some targets can't be made.
        -l [N], --load-average[=N], --max-load[=N]                               Don't start multiple jobs unless load is below N.
        -L, --check-symlink-times   Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.
        -n, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon                               Don't actually run any recipe; just print them.
        -o FILE, --old-file=FILE, --assume-old=FILE                               Consider FILE to be very old and don't remake it.
        -O[TYPE], --output-sync[=TYPE]                               Synchronize output of parallel jobs by TYPE.
        -p, --print-data-base       Print make's internal database.
        -q, --question              Run no recipe; exit status says if up to date.
        -r, --no-builtin-rules      Disable the built-in implicit rules.
        -R, --no-builtin-variables  Disable the built-in variable settings.
        -s, --silent, --quiet       Don't echo recipes.
        --no-silent                 Echo recipes (disable --silent mode).
        -S, --no-keep-going, --stop                                Turns off -k.
        -t, --touch                 Touch targets instead of remaking them.
        --trace                     Print tracing information.
        -v, --version               Print the version number of make and exit.
        -w, --print-directory       Print the current directory.
        --no-print-directory        Turn off -w, even if it was turned on implicitly.
        -W FILE, --what-if=FILE, --new-file=FILE, --assume-new=FILE                                Consider FILE to be infinitely new.
        --warn-undefined-variables  Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.

`-B`, `--always-make` Consider all targets out-of-date.

`-C` [dir]`--directory=[dir]`

`-f [file]', `--file=[file]`,  `--makefile=[file]` - specify another file to use.

`-s` - run silently.

`-d` Print debugging information in addition to normal processing. The debugging information says which files are being considered for remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what results, which files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are applied

`--debug[=options]` a (all) | b (basic) | v (verbose) | i (implicit) | j (jobs) | m (makefile) | n (none)

`-e`,  `--environment-overrides`   Give variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from makefiles. 

`-E` [string] `--eval=`[string] - Evaluate string as makefile syntax. This is a command-line version of the eval function (see Eval Function). The evaluation is performed after the default rules and variables have been defined, but before any makefiles are read.

`-h`, `--help` to see make specific help. Remind you of the options that make understands and then exit.

`-i` `--ignore-errors`, Ignore all errors in recipes executed to remake files. See Errors in Recipes.

`-I` [dir], `--include-dir`=[dir] Specifies a directory dir to search for included makefiles. See Including Other Makefiles. If several `-I` options are used to specify several directories, the directories are searched in the order specified.

`-k`  `--keep-going` Continue as much as possible after an error. 

`-L` `--check-symlink-times` On systems that support symbolic links, this option causes make to consider the timestamps on any symbolic links in addition to the timestamp on the file referenced by those links. 

`-n`  `--just-print` , `--dry-run` ,`--recon`  - With the `-n` flag, make prints the recipe that it would normally execute but usually does not execute it. “No-op”. Causes make to print the recipes that are needed to make the targets up to date, but not actually execute them. Note that some recipes are still executed, even with this flag (see How the MAKE Variable Works). Also any recipes needed to update included makefiles are still executed (see How Makefiles Are Remade).

`-O[type]` `--output-sync[=type]` -    Ensure that the complete output from each recipe is printed in one uninterrupted sequence. 

`-o` [file]' `--old-file=[file]` `--assume-old=[file]`     Do not remake the file file even if it is older than its prerequisites, and do not remake anything on account of changes in file. Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules are ignored. See Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files.

`-p` `--print-data-base` Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also prints the version information given by the `-v` switch (see below). 

`-q`, `--question` “Question”. Silently check whether the targets are up to date, but do not execute recipes; the exit code shows whether any updates are needed.  `0` is up to date 1 is not.

`-s` , `--silent` `--quiet` Silent operation; do not print the recipes as they are executed. See Recipe Echoing.

`-S` `--no-keep-going` `--stop` Cancel the effect of the `-k` option. This is never necessary except in a recursive make where `-k` might be inherited from the top-level make via MAKEFLAGS (see Recursive Use of make) or if you set `-k` in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.

`-t`, `--touch` With the `-t` flag, make ignores the recipes in the rules and uses (in effect) the command touch for each target that needs to be remade. 

    “Touch”. Marks targets as up to date without actually changing them. In other words, make pretends to update the targets but does not really change their contents; instead only their modified times are updated.

`-v` `--version` Print the version of the make program plus a copyright, a list of authors, and a notice that there is no warranty; then exit.

`-w` `--print-directory` Print a message containing the working directory both before and after executing the makefile. This may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated nests of recursive make commands.

`--no-print-directory` Disable printing of the working directory under -w. This option is useful when -w is turned on automatically, but you do not want to see the extra messages. 

`-W` [file] `--what-if`=[file] “What if”. `--assume-new=[file]`,`--new-file=[file]` Each `-W` flag is followed by a file name. The given files' modification times are recorded by make as being the present time, although the actual modification times remain the same. 

`--warn-undefined-variables`    Issue a warning message whenever make sees a reference to an undefined variable. This can be helpful when you are trying to debug makefiles which use variables in complex ways.

```
foo : foo.c -lcurses
        cc $^ -o $@
```
`lcurses` is a library curses.c, and will check library for curses.a and if older replaces it.


```sh
ci all install tags clean bare promote depend ci locked:
    -X=`pwd`; \
    for i in $(SUBS); \
    do echo '<<<' $$i '>>>'; cd $$X/$$i; make $@; done
```

The initial "-" is actually not part of the shell script, but when placed before command lines, will cause the error status of the command to be ignored. From there, the rest is shell script

X= current directory

for i in a list of subs.  do {
    echo '<<< $$i >>>' ? (Maybe literally prints
    then we do cd Root/$sub and make $@ )
}

```make

%.o : %.c
	$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@
	touch $@
	echo "Compiled"

% : %.o
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) n.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS) && .\$@


   test: $(SRC)
	cc -c $< 
# 	cc $(SRC:.c=.o) -o $(SRC:.c=)
# 	$(ROOT)$(SRC:.c=)
```




SUBDIRS = foo bar baz

subdirs:
        for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
          $(MAKE) -C $$dir; \
        done

There are problems with this method, however. First, any error detected in a sub-make is ignored by this rule, so it will continue to build the rest of the directories even when one fails. This can be overcome by adding shell commands to note the error and exit, but then it will do so even if make is invoked with the -k option, which is unfortunate.

To create library object files for foo.c and hello.c, simply invoke libtool with the standard compilation command as arguments (see Compile mode):

        >$ libtool --mode=compile gcc -g -O -c foo.c
            gcc -g -O -c foo.c -o foo.o
        >$ libtool --mode=compile gcc -g -O -c hello.c
            gcc -g -O -c hello.c -o hello.o
        >$

Without libtool, the programmer would invoke the ar command to create a static library:

burger$ ar cru libhello.a hello.o foo.o

`ar` is just an archive program.  Like `tar` is just `tape archive` so this doesnt 'do' anything.

Then `ranlib` adds a file table.

### Reserved Characters


punctuator: one of ( ) [ ] { } * , : = ; ... #

These characters have special meanings in C. Their uses are described throughout this book. The pound sign (#) can occur only in preprocessing directives.
## Naming

Do not select names for identifiers that begin with two underscores or with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter. 

Identifiers with file-level scope should also not be named with an underscore and a lowercase letter as the first two letters.

 By convention, Microsoft uses an underscore and an uppercase letter to begin macro names 
 
 and double underscores for Microsoft-specific keyword names.
 
  To avoid any naming conflicts, always select identifier names that do not begin with one or two underscores, or names that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter.

## Basic Program arrangment

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    

    return 0;
}
```

`int main(int argc, char **argv){` This also works

## Types

The C data types fall into general categories. 


The _integral types_ include `int`, `char`, `short`, `long`, and `long long`. 

These types can be qualified with `signed` or `unsigned,` and *"unsigned"* by itself can be used as shorthand for `unsigned int`. 

**Enumeration types** (`enum`) are also treated as *integral types* for most purposes. 

The _floating types_ include `float`, `double`, and `long double`. The arithmetic types include all floating and integral types.

| Type                             | Storage |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| char, unsigned char, signed char | 1 byte  |
| short, unsigned short            | 2 bytes |
| int, unsigned int                | 4 bytes |
| long, unsigned long              | 4 bytes |
| long long, unsigned long long    | 8 bytes |
| float                            | 4 bytes |
| double                           | 8 bytes |
| long double                      | 8 bytes |


### Char 

Character values of type unsigned char have a range from 0 to 0xFF hexadecimal. A signed char has range 0x80 to 0x7F. These ranges translate to 0 to 255 decimal, and -128 to +127 decimal, respectively. The /J compiler option changes the default from signed to unsigned.

char    schar =  'x';   /* A character constant          */
wchar_t wchar = L'x';   /* A wide-character constant for
                            the same character           */

#### Char escapes

Escape Sequence 	Represents
\a 	Bell (alert)
\b 	Backspace
\f 	Form feed
\n 	New line
\r 	Carriage return
\t 	Horizontal tab
\v 	Vertical tab
\' 	Single quotation mark
\" 	Double quotation mark
\\ 	Backslash
\? 	Literal question mark
\ ooo 	ASCII character in octal notation
\x hh 	ASCII character in hexadecimal notation
\x hhhh 	Unicode character in hexadecimal notation if this escape sequence is used in a wide-character constant or a Unicode string literal.

For example,` WCHAR f = L'\x4e00'` or `WCHAR b[] = L"The Chinese character for one is \x4e00".`


[Multibyte and Wide Characters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/multibyte-and-wide-characters?view=msvc-160)

### String Literal Concatenation

    "Long strings can be bro\
    ken into two or more pieces."

is identical to the string

    Long strings can be broken into two or more pieces."

        
    printf_s ( "This is the first half of the string, "
              "this is the second half ") ;

              "This is the first half of the string, this is the second half"


  A string pointer, initialized as two distinct string literals separated only by white space, is stored as a single string (pointers are discussed in Pointer Declarations). When properly referenced, as in the following example, the result is identical to the previous example:

          char *string = "This is the first half of the string, "
                        "this is the second half";

          printf_s( "%s" , string ) ;
###  Ints

The size of a **signed int** or **unsigned int** item is the standard size of an integer **on a particular machine.** 

For example, in 16-bit operating systems, the int type is usually 16 bits, or 2 bytes. In 32-bit operating systems, the int type is usually 32 bits, or 4 bytes. Thus, the int type is equivalent to either the short int or the long int type, and the unsigned int type is equivalent to either the unsigned short or the unsigned long type, depending on the target environment. The int types all represent signed values unless specified otherwise.

The type specifiers int and unsigned int (or simply unsigned) define certain features of the C language (for instance, the enum type). In these cases, the definitions of int and unsigned int for a particular implementation determine the actual storage.

#### Specific Sizes

You can declare 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit integer variables by using the __intN type specifier, where N is the size, in bits, of the integer variable. The value of n can be 8, 16, 32, or 64. The following example declares one variable of each of the four types of sized integers:

__int8  nSmall;     // Declares 8-bit integer  == Char
__int16 nMedium;    // Declares 16-bit integer == short
__int32 nLarge;     // Declares 32-bit integer == int
__int64 nHuge;      // Declares 64-bit integer == long long

int and long seem equivalent


#### Int Constants

If an integer constant begins with 0x or 0X, it is hexadecimal. If it begins with the digit 0, it is octal. Otherwise, it is assumed to be decimal.

    28
    0x1C   /* = Hexadecimal representation for decimal 28 */
    034    /* = Octal representation for decimal 28 */
     /* Decimal Constants */
    int                 dec_int    = 28;
    unsigned            dec_uint   = 4000000024u;
    long                dec_long   = 2000000022l;
    unsigned long       dec_ulong  = 4000000000ul;
    long long           dec_llong  = 9000000000LL;
    unsigned long long  dec_ullong = 900000000001ull;
    __int64             dec_i64    = 9000000000002I64;
    unsigned __int64    dec_ui64   = 90000000000004ui64;

    /* Octal Constants */
    int                 oct_int    = 024;
    unsigned            oct_uint   = 04000000024u;
    long                oct_long   = 02000000022l;
    unsigned long       oct_ulong  = 04000000000UL;
    long long           oct_llong  = 044000000000000ll;
    unsigned long long  oct_ullong = 044400000000000001Ull;
    __int64             oct_i64    = 04444000000000000002i64;
    unsigned __int64    oct_ui64   = 04444000000000000004uI64;

    /* Hexadecimal Constants */
    int                 hex_int    = 0x2a;
    unsigned            hex_uint   = 0XA0000024u;
    long                hex_long   = 0x20000022l;
    unsigned long       hex_ulong  = 0XA0000021uL;
    long long           hex_llong  = 0x8a000000000000ll;
    unsigned long long  hex_ullong = 0x8A40000000000010uLL;
    __int64             hex_i64    = 0x4a44000000000020I64;
    unsigned __int64    hex_ui64   = 0x8a44000000000040Ui64;

    /* Long decimal constants */
      10L
      79L

      /* Long octal constants */
      012L
      0115L

      /* Long hexadecimal constants */
      0xaL or 0xAL
      0X4fL or 0x4FL

      /* Unsigned long decimal constant */
      776745UL
      778866LU

 

The type for a decimal constant without a suffix is either **int,** **long int,** or **unsigned long int.** The first of these three types in which the constant's value can be represented is the type assigned to the constant.

The type assigned to **octal** and **hexadecimal** constants without suffixes is **int,** **unsigned int,** **long int,** or **unsigned long int depending** on the size of the constant.

The type assigned to constants with a `u` or `U` suffix is **unsigned int** or **unsigned long int** depending on their size.

The type assigned to constants with an `l` or` L` suffix is **long int** or **unsigned long int** depending on their size.

The type assigned to constants with a `u` or `U` and an `l` or` L `suffix is **unsigned long int.**

A pointer to void is a "generic" pointer type. A `void *` can be converted to any other pointer type without an explicit cast. _You cannot dereference a `void *` or do pointer arithmetic with it; you_ must convert it to a pointer to a complete data type first.

void * is often used in places where you need to be able to work with different pointer types in the same code. One commonly cited example is the library function qsort:

void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, 
           int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));

base is the address of an array, nmemb is the number of elements in the array, size is the size of each element, and compar is a pointer to a function that compares two elements of the array. It gets called like so:

```c++
int iArr[10];
double dArr[30];
long lArr[50];
...
qsort(iArr, sizeof iArr/sizeof iArr[0], sizeof iArr[0], compareInt);
qsort(dArr, sizeof dArr/sizeof dArr[0], sizeof dArr[0], compareDouble);
qsort(lArr, sizeof lArr/sizeof lArr[0], sizeof lArr[0], compareLong);
```
The array expressions iArr, dArr, and lArr are implicitly converted from array types to pointer types in the function call, and each is implicitly converted from "pointer to int/double/long" to "pointer to void".

The comparison functions would look something like:


```C++
int compareInt(const void *lhs, const void *rhs)
{
  const int *x = lhs;  // convert void * to int * by assignment
  const int *y = rhs;

  if (*x > *y) return 1;
  if (*x == *y) return 0;
  return -1;
}

```


By accepting void *, qsort can work with arrays of any type.

The disadvantage of using `void *` is that you throw type safety out the window and into oncoming traffic. There's nothing to protect you from using the wrong comparison routine:

`qsort(dArr, sizeof dArr/sizeof dArr[0], sizeof dArr[0], compareInt);`

compareInt is expecting its arguments to be pointing to ints, but is actually working with doubles. There's no way to catch this problem at compile time; you'll just wind up with a missorted array. 

, in socket functions, you have

send(void * pData, int nLength)

this means you can call it in many ways, for example

```c
char * data = "blah";
send(data, strlen(data));

POINT p;
p.x = 1;
p.y = 2;
send(&p, sizeof(POINT));
```

Also as a pointer to a function:

```C
#include <stdio.h> 
// A normal function with an int parameter 
// and void return type 
void fun(int a) 
{ 
    printf("Value of a is %d\n", a); 
} 
  
int main() 
{ 
    // fun_ptr is a pointer to function fun()  
    void (*fun_ptr)(int) = &fun; 
  
    /* The above line is equivalent of following two 
       void (*fun_ptr)(int); 
       fun_ptr = &fun;  
    */
  
    // Invoking fun() using fun_ptr 
    (*fun_ptr)(10); 
  
    return 0; 
} 
```

`void (*fun_ptr)(int) = &fun;`
`void (*fun_ptr)(int); `
` fun_ptr = &fun;`

### Strings

char arrays in C


Wide char - string literals (e.g. Unicode)

Given by L"string"

The wide-character-string literal L"hello" becomes an array of six integers of type **wchar_t.**

### C type library

The ctype.h header file of the C Standard Library declares several functions that are useful for testing and mapping characters.

!!!Note All the functions accepts int as a parameter, whose value must be EOF or representable as an unsigned char.

!!!Note All the functions return non-zero (true) if the argument c satisfies the condition described, and zero(false) if not.

#### Functions

- `int isalnum(int c)` - This function checks whether the passed character is alphanumeric.

- `int isalpha(int c)` - This function checks whether the passed character is alphabetic.

- `int iscntrl(int c)` - This function checks whether the passed character is control character.

- `int isdigit(int c)` - This function checks whether the passed character is decimal digit.

- `int toupper(int c)` - This function converts lowercase letters to uppercase.

#### Character Classes

- `Digits` - This is a set of whole numbers { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }.

- `Hexadecimal digits` - This is the set of { 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f }.

- `Lowercase letters` - This is a set of lowercase letters { a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z }.

- `Uppercase letters` - This is a set of uppercase letters {A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z }.

- `Blank characters` - These are spaces and tabs.

- `Alphabetic characters` - This is a set of Lowercase letters and Uppercase letters.



## printing

`puts()` = print.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
    static char *intro = "Please enter your value?";
    puts(intro);

    return 0;
}
```

Unlike normal pointers, we do not allocate de-allocate memory using function pointers.

 
A function's name can also be used to get functions' address. For example, in the below program, we have removed address operator '&' in assignment. We have also changed function call by removing *, the program still works.


```C++
#include <stdio.h> 
// A normal function with an int parameter 
// and void return type 
void fun(int a) 
{ 
    printf("Value of a is %d\n", a); 
} 
  
int main() 
{  
    void (*fun_ptr)(int) = fun;  // & removed 
  
    fun_ptr(10);  // * removed 
  
    return 0; 
}
```

### storage-class-specifier:

- local:    
  - `auto`
  - `register`
- global
  - `static`
  - `extern`

- `typedef`
- `__declspec` *( extended-decl-modifier-seq )* **Microsoft-specific*


Except for `__declspec`, you can use only one storage-class-specifier in the declaration-specifier in a declaration. If no storage-class specification is made, declarations within a block create automatic objects.

Items declared with the `auto` or `register` specifier have local lifetimes. Items declared with the `static` or `extern` specifier have global lifetimes.


#### static

[Storage-Class Specifiers for External-Level Declarations | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/storage-class-specifiers-for-external-level-declarations?view=msvc-160)

> Variables declared outside all blocks without the **`static`** keyword always **retain their values throughout the program.** To restrict their access to a particular translation unit, you must use the **`static`** keyword. This gives them _internal linkage_.

>  To make them global to an entire program, omit the explicit storage class or use the keyword **`extern`** (see the rules in the next list). This gives them _external linkage_.


> -   The **`static`** storage-class specifier can apply to functions as well. If you declare a function **`static`**, _its name is invisible outside of the file in which it's declared._
>  


 function declared to be static is visible only within the source file in which it is defined. Functions in the same source file can call the static function, but functions in other source files cannot access it directly by name. You can declare another static function with the same name in a different source file without conflict.

Functions declared as extern are visible throughout all source files in the program (unless you later redeclare such a function as static). Any function can call an extern function.

Function declarations that omit the storage-class specifier are extern by default.


#### extern 

[Storage-Class Specifiers for External-Level Declarations | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/storage-class-specifiers-for-external-level-declarations?view=msvc-160)

> The rules for using **`extern`** are:
> 
> -   The **`extern`** storage-class specifier _declares a reference to a variable defined elsewhere._ You can use an **`extern`** declaration to make a definition in another source file visible,
> or *to make a variable visible before its definition in the same source file. Once* you've declared a reference to the variable at the external level, the variable is visible throughout the remainder of the translation unit in which the declared reference occurs.
>     
> -   For an **`extern`** reference to be valid, the variable it refers to must be defined once, and only once, at the external level. This definition (without the *`extern`* storage class) can be in any of the translation units that make up the program.


From the [C++ article ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/extern-cpp?view=msvc-160)


The extern keyword has four meanings depending on the context:

    In a non-const global variable declaration, extern specifies that the variable or function is defined in another translation unit. The extern must be applied in all files except the one where the variable is defined.

    In a const variable declaration, it specifies that the variable has external linkage. The extern must be applied to all declarations in all files. (Global const variables have internal linkage by default.)

    extern "C" specifies that the function is defined elsewhere and uses the C-language calling convention. The extern "C" modifier may also be applied to multiple function declarations in a block.

    In a template declaration, extern specifies that the template has already been instantiated elsewhere. extern tells the compiler it can reuse the other instantiation, rather than create a new one at the current location. For more information about this use of extern, see Explicit instantiation.
#### auto 

!!! warning unsure if this auto is the same as C++ auto 

Yes see this :



!!!Note From the [C++ page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/auto-cpp?view=msvc-160)
  The C++ standard defines an original and a revised meaning for this keyword. Before Visual Studio 2010, the auto keyword declares a variable in the automatic storage class; that is, a variable that has a local lifetime. Starting with Visual Studio 2010, the auto keyword declares a variable whose type is deduced from the initialization expression in its declaration. The /Zc:auto[-] compiler option controls the meaning of the auto keyword.



The auto storage-class specifier declares an automatic variable, a variable with a local lifetime. An auto variable is visible only in the block in which it is declared. Declarations of auto variables can include initializers, as discussed in Initialization. Since variables with auto storage class are not initialized automatically, you should either explicitly initialize them when you declare them, or assign them initial values in statements within the block. The values of uninitialized auto variables are undefined. (A local variable of auto or register storage class is initialized each time it comes in scope if an initializer is given.)


### Type qualifiers

Type qualifiers give one of two properties to an identifier. The const type qualifier declares an object to be nonmodifiable. The volatile type qualifier declares an item whose value can legitimately be changed by something beyond the control of the program in which it appears, such as a concurrently executing thread.

The type qualifiers, const, restrict, and volatile, can appear only once in a declaration. Type qualifiers can appear with any type specifier; however, they can't appear after the first comma in a multiple item declaration. For example, the following declarations are legal:

The following are legal const and volatile declarations:
C

      int const *p_ci;      // Pointer to constant int
      int const (*p_ci);   // Pointer to constant int
      int *const cp_i;     // Constant pointer to int
      int (*const cp_i);   // Constant pointer to int
      int volatile vint;     // Volatile integer


#### Const

The const keyword can be used to modify any fundamental or aggregate type, or a pointer to an object of any type, or a typedef. If an item is declared with only the const type qualifier, its type is taken to be const int. A const variable can be initialized or can be placed in a read-only region of storage. The const keyword is useful for declaring pointers to const since this requires the function not to change the pointer in any way.



#### volitile

    The compiler assumes that, at any point in the program, a volatile variable can be accessed by an unknown process that uses or modifies its value. Regardless of the optimizations specified on the command line, the code for each assignment to or reference of a volatile variable must be generated even if it appears to have no effect.

If volatile is used alone, int is assumed. The volatile type specifier can be used to provide reliable access to special memory locations. Use volatile with data objects that may be accessed or altered by signal handlers, by concurrently executing programs, or by special hardware such as memory-mapped I/O control registers. You can declare a variable as volatile for its lifetime, or you can cast a single reference to be volatile.

    An item can be both const and volatile, in which case the item couldn't be legitimately modified by its own program, but could be modified by some asynchronous process.

#### restrict

restrict is an optimization hint to the compiler that no other pointer in the current scope refers to the same memory location. That is, only the pointer or a value derived from it (such as pointer + 1) is used to access the object during the lifetime of the pointer. This helps the compiler produce more optimized code. C++ has an equivalent mechanism, __restrict

Keep in mind that restrict is a contract between you and the compiler. If you do alias a pointer marked with restrict, the result is undefined.

```C
    void test(int* restrict first, int* restrict second, int* val)
{
    *first += *val;
    *second += *val;
}

int main()
{
    int i = 1, j = 2, k = 3;
    test(&i, &j, &k);

    return 0;
}

// Marking union members restrict tells the compiler that
// only z.x or z.y will be accessed in any scope, which allows
// the compiler to optimize access to the members.
union z 
{
    int* restrict x;
    double* restrict y;
};
```

## Strings

They suck in C

```C
xxxxx myName() {
  return "Flavio";
}
```

he tricky thing is defining the return value type.

Strings in C are arrays of char elements, so we can't really return a string - we must return a pointer to the first element of the string.

This is why we need to use const char*:

```c
const char* myName() {
  return "Flavio";
}
```

This works  

        #include <stdio.h>

        const char* myName() {
            return "Flavio";
        }

        int main(void) {
            printf("%s", myName());
            const char * result = MyName();
        }


Note the use of const, because from the function I'm returning a string literal, a string defined in double quotes, which is a constant.


```c

#include <stdio.h>

//this fails
const char* myName() {
  char name[6] = "Flavio"; 
  return name;
}

//this works
const char* myName() {
  char *name = "Flavio";
  return name;
}

int main(void) {
  printf("%s", myName());
}

```
### Structs 

```C
struct employee   /* Defines a structure variable named temp */
{
    char name[20];
    int id;
    long class;
} temp;
```


The *employee* structure has three members: **name,** **id,** and **class.** The **name** member is a 20-element array, and **id** and **class** are simple members with *int* and *long* type, respectively. The identifier _employee_ is the structure identifier.

Its a variable named `temp`

e.g. `[struct] employee temp`



```C
struct employee student, faculty, staff;
```

This example defines three structure variables: **student,** **faculty,** and **staff.** Each structure has the same list of three members. The members are declared to have the _structure type **employee,_** defined in the previous example.

```C
struct           /* Defines an anonymous struct and a */
{                /* structure variable named complex  */
    float x, y;
} complex;
```

The complex structure has two members with float type, x and y. The structure type has no tag and is therefore unnamed or anonymous.

```C
struct sample   /* Defines a structure named x */
{
    char c;
    float *pf;
    struct sample *next;
} x;
```

The first two members of the structure are a char variable and a pointer to a float value. The third member, next, is declared as a pointer to the structure type being defined (sample).

Anonymous structures can be useful when the tag named is not needed. This is the case when one declaration defines all structure instances. For example:
```C
struct
{
    int x;
    int y;
} mystruct;
```

Embedded structures are often anonymous.

```C
struct somestruct
{
    struct    /* Anonymous structure */
    {
        int x, y;
    } point;
    int type;
} w;

```

!!! Warning : This my be microsoft Specific
  Unsized arrays can appear only as the last member of a structure. Structures containing unsized array declarations can be nested within other structures as long as no further members are declared in any enclosing structures. Arrays of such structures are not allowed. The sizeof operator, when applied to a variable of this type or to the type itself, assumes 0 for the size of the array.

this chapter, we will discuss in detail about special variable in Unix. In one of our previous chapters, we understood how to be careful when we use certain nonalphanumeric characters in variable names. This is because those characters are used in the names of special Unix variables. These variables are reserved for specific functions.

For example, the $ character represents the process ID number, or PID, of the current shell −

$echo $$


The above command writes the PID of the current shell −

29949

The following table shows a number of special variables that you can use in your shell scripts −
Sr.No. 	Variable & Description
- `$0` - The filename of the current script.

- `$n` - These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here n is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is $1, the second argument is $2, and so on).

- `$#` - The number of arguments supplied to a script.

- `$*` - All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.

- `$@` - All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.

- `$?` - The exit status of the last command executed.

- `$$` - The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.

- `$!` - The process number of the last background command.




## Variable Arguments

A function may accept a varying number of additional arguments without corresponding parameter declarations by including a comma and three dots (,...) after its regular named parameters:

return_type function_name ( parameter_declarations , ... );
To access these additional arguments the macros va_start, va_arg and va_end, declared in this header, can be used:

    First, va_start initializes the list of variable arguments as a va_list.
    Subsequent executions of va_arg yield the values of the additional arguments in the same order as passed to the function.
    Finally, va_end shall be executed before the function returns.

- `va_list` - Type to hold information about variable arguments (type )

Macro functions

- `va_start` - Initialize a variable argument list (macro )
- `va_arg` - Retrieve next argument (macro )
- `va_end` - End using variable argument list (macro )
- `va_copy` - Copy variable argument list (macro 

```C
    /* vsprintf example */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

void PrintFError ( const char * format, ... )
{
  char buffer[256];
  va_list args;
  va_start (args, format);
  vsprintf (buffer,format, args);
  perror (buffer);
  va_end (args);
}

int main ()
{
  FILE * pFile;
  char szFileName[]="myfile.txt";

  pFile = fopen (szFileName,"r");
  if (pFile == NULL)
    PrintFError ("Error opening '%s'",szFileName);
  else
  {
    // file successfully open
    fclose (pFile);
  }
  return 0;
}
```


## Strings


function
<cstring>
strcat

char * strcat ( char * destination, const char * source );

Concatenate strings
Appends a copy of the source string to the destination string. The terminating null character in destination is overwritten by the first character of source, and a null-character is included at the end of the new string formed by the concatenation of both in destination.

```c
/* strcat example */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main ()
{
  char str[80];
  strcpy (str,"these ");
  strcat (str,"strings ");
  strcat (str,"are ");
  strcat (str,"concatenated.");
  puts (str);
  return 0;
}


```


function
<cstring>
strncat

char * strncat ( char * destination, const char * source, size_t num );

Append characters from string
Appends the first num characters of source to destination, plus a terminating null-character.

If the length of the C string in source is less than num, only the content up to the terminating null-character is copied.


- `destination` - Pointer to the destination array, which should contain a C string, and be large enough to contain the concatenated resulting string, including the additional null-character.source
    C string to be appended.
- `num` - Maximum number of characters to be appended.    size_t is an unsigned integral type. 
- `` - Example


	

/* strncat example */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main ()
{
  char str1[20];
  char str2[20];
  strcpy (str1,"To be ");
  strcpy (str2,"or not to be");
  strncat (str1, str2, 6);
  puts (str1);
  return 0;
}

## errno.h

[C Library - <errno.h> - Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/errorno_h.htm)

> The **errno.h** header file of the C Standard Library defines the integer variable **errno**, which is set by system calls and some library functions in the event of an error to indicate what went wrong. This macro expands to a modifiable lvalue of type int, therefore it can be both read and modified by a program.
> 
> The **errno** is set to zero at program startup. Certain functions of the standard C library modify its value to other than zero to signal some types of error. You can also modify its value or reset to zero at your convenience.
