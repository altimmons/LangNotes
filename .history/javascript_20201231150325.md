## NPM

### Getting Started
   
List everything you have installed in the current directory

      npm ls

Search the registry for packages matching terms

      npm search[search terms]

Install a package

      npm install[<name> [<name> ...]] [--save|--save-dev|--save-optional]

This command installs a package, or packages, and any packages that it depends on in the current directory. If the package has a shrinkwrap file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that.

If no package.json exists, these options are ignored. If it exists, they'll update them if they are already there.

- `--save`: Package will appear in your depedencies.
- `--save-dev`: Package will appear in your devDependencies.
- `--save-optional`: Package will appear in your optionalDependencies.
- `--global`: Package will be installed globally (if you want to use it as a command line tool for example)

Install a package in the version

            npm install <module-name>@<version-name>

Uninstall a package, completely removing everything npm installed on its behalf
      
      npm uninstall

Update all the packages listed to the latest version (specified by the tag config). Also install missing packages
      
      npm update [<name> [<name> ...]]
Update the global npm version
      
      npm update npm -g

Display the README.md / documentation / npmjs.org page of a give library
      
      npm docs <module-name>
Run package test suite, based on setup in package.json in
            
      "scripts" : {"test" : "node testfile.js"}

List outdated libraries compared to currently installed node_modules
            
      npm outdated

Lock down dependency versions
            
      npm shrinkwrap

### Develop
    
Interactively create a package.json file
            
      npm init
         
Asks you a bunch of questions, and then writes a package.json for you. If you already have a package.json file, it'll read that first, and default to the options in there.
            
Install a git specific release
            
      npm install git://github.com/Marak/colors.js#v0.6.0

Locally edit a dependency
            
      npm edit <module_name>

Setup editor for npm edit
               
      npm config set editor "sublime"

Publish a package not under the default "latest" tag
               
      npm publish --tag beta
