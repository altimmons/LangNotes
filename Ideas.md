# Ideas

This is a general document to jot down some "`Ideas`" and thoughts of all sorts. Things to do, gift ideas, get rich quick schemes, etc.

## Product Idea -> Baby Activity Monitor

Reading on the internet, many people seem interested in logging their kids behaviour. They collect in excel sleeping times, how much they eat, how much they poop, their attitudes etc.

Idea is for a wearable device (Like a fit bit) that tracks kids activity

Essentially 3 differentactivity levels (At least inital idea)

- Sleeping
- Awake (not Crying)
  - Feeding?
- Crying

Sensors for Ambient Light (helps for determinging sleeping if dark). Ambient noise (important will be discernment from ambient noise and crying.) (freq?) ANd Motion sensor. Need to collect motion.

Needs to be too large to swallow. Needs to be all one piece (safety.)

## Product Idea -> Tech Nerd Travel Kit

Neat assortment of gizmos that people need on the go. In an attractive (flat folding?) Package?

- Patch / Ethernet cable
