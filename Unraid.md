## Network Settings

Change to Jumbo Frames:

https://wiki.unraid.net/Improving_unRAID_Performance#:~:text=You%20can%20set%20the%20MTU,experiment%20with%20different%20MTU%20settings.

ifconfig

Ive set eth 4/5 as the 10gb adapter.

Direct connection:

On linux- 192.168.99.2


Note, in retrospect, I wish I'd used a different subnet/ip

Ok changed to 169.254.0.1 & 2

on linux (unraid)

Set jumbo frames:

ifconfig eth4 mtu 9014

to make persistant append this to /boot/config/network.cfg

```
#added 10/31/20 alt
ifcongig eth4 mtu 9014
```

added a route


```
>> route add -host 169.254.0.1 gw 169.254.0.2 metric 0 dev eth4

169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 eth4
DESKTOP.local   Unraid.local    255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth4
```
On windows:

Need to do `route print interface` to print the interfaces.

Then 
`>route -p add 192.168.99.2 192.168.99.1 IF 37`


## Nice to know commands



### Docker service

`/etc/rc.d/rc.docker <command>`

Available commands: `start stop restart status`

### Docker containers

`docker <command> <containername>`
Available commands: `start stop restart pasue logs`

Print all container names:


`docker ps --format ‘{{.Names}}’`

Print all container images:


`docker ps --format ‘{{.Image}}’`

### Nginx

`/etc/rc.d/rc.nginx <command>`
Available commands: `start stop restart status`

### PHP

`/etc/rc.d/rc.php-fpm <command>`

Available commands: `start stop restart status`

### VM Service

`/etc/rc.d/rc.libvirt <command>`

Available commands: `start stop`


### Domains

List all domains:

`virsh list --all`

`virsh <command> <domain>`
Available commands: `start shutdown reboot suspend`

### Samba

`/etc/rd.d/rc.samba <command>`

Available commands: `start stop`

### Unraid

- Shutdown/Reboot
   `/sbin/<command>`

   Available commands: `reboot poweroff shutdown`

   Note `poweroff` will gracefully shut everything down, even spin down the hard drives, but will not actually turn off the power supply.But there is a race condition in the code which could cause the system to power off before the Flash is updated indicating 'clean shutdown'. This can't cause data loss, but will cause parity-check to automatically start upon next reboot.

- Run diagnostics

   `diagnostics`

- Tail the syslog

   `tail -f /var/log/syslog`

- Look at the parameters in the config file

   `nano /boot/syslinux.cfg-`

- Create a backup image of your usb and store it on disk1

   `dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/disk1/unraid.img`

- Copy files using midnight commander

   `mc`
- Check power on hours for all drives

   `for drive in $(ls -la /dev | grep -Ev 'sda|sd[a-z][0-9]' | grep sd[a-z] | awk '{print $10}'); do hours=$(smartctl --all /dev/${drive} | grep Power_On_Hours | awk '{print $10}'); echo "Power on Hours for ${drive}: ${hours}"; echo ''; done`


## Recovering Nginx

!!! Fail  : Did not succeed
      The underlying issue was that `/boot/config/go` I had moved the emhttpd command to the bottom and it was erroring out before running it.

                  # Start the Management Utility
            /usr/local/sbin/emhttp &

### stop mover
`mover stop`

### Check whats wrong:

`nginx`

## Sharing error

[More on NFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS#Server)


initially `/etc/exports` was 

         #"/mnt/user/rA" -async,no_subtree_check,fsid=100 *(sec=sys,rw,insecure,anongid=100,anonuid=99,all_squash)

Which gave

      `May 9 22:30:01 Unraid mountd[30694]: refused mount request from 192.168.1.25 for /mnt/user/rA (/): not exported`

Or similar, lost original error, added this from another user and edited.

After much searching, and adding NFS rules in, I found that users go AFTER.  

as opposed to THIS example 

      "#"/mnt/user/rA"    192.168.1.0/255.255.0.0(ro,async,no_subtree_check,fsid=100) *(sec=sys,rw,insecure,anongid=100,anonuid=99,all_squ>" 

```bash
  GNU nano 4.6                                                  exports                                                             
# See exports(5) for a description.
# This file contains a list of all directories exported to other computers.
# It is used by rpc.nfsd and rpc.mountd.


"/mnt/user/rA" -async,no_subtree_check,fsid=100 DESKTOP 169.254.0.0/255.255.255.248 192.168.1.0/24
"/mnt/user/"    -ro,sync,no_subtree_check,fsid=100 169.254.0.2/255.255.255.248 DESKTOP 192.168.1.0/24
```

This seems to work.  Usng multiple users.  Will have to add laptop.


## More NFS

!!! Attention These are Windows Specific Commands

 Samba was fraught with errors

 Decided to use NFS.

 Check Windows Features NFS Client is installed.

 ran the following on windows:

 ```cmd
>mount \\169.254.0.2\rA\ A:

```

it has reverted to before my changes.

In addition, my changes were deleted on reboot.  Irritating, I may have to do this every time...


!!!Success Solution: 

      appended `169.254.0.0/28 192.168.1.0/24` to the end of `/etc/exports`.

      ```sh
      "/mnt/user/rA" -async,no_subtree_check,fsid=100 DESKTOP  169.254.0.0/28 192.168.1.0/24

Explorer - navigating to A:\ gives cannot be found error.

However, oddly `cd /d A:` works fine...

[Google reveals](https://superuser.com/questions/599641/nfs-mount-not-showing-in-windows-explorer#:~:text=If%20you%20mount%20NFS%20shares,not%20required%20for%20NFS%20mounts.)



      If you mount **NFS shares from an elevated command prompt** (Run as administrator), the mount will not show up in the explorer running with normal user privileges. The solution is to unmount the share and remount it, either from explorer or from an ordinary command prompt. Admin privileges are not required for NFS mounts.


ok, unmount it

no dismount or unmount command, shows in NET USE.

```cmd

unsure of that significance right now...

then tried the below based on [this](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2055587)

      mount -u:andyt -p:Lauren7! \\UNRAID\mnt\user\rA\ A:

Can I read it?

Ok yes I can read it for now....

Online answer but doesnt work

            sudo dhclient -v -r eth0
            sudo dhclient -v eth0

This (sort of) works

            dhcpcd -k eth3

Background processing
The ability to run commands in the background is one of the key benefits of the UNIX system. You can set any command line running in the background while you do something else at the prompt.

To set a command running in the background, type the command at the prompt as usual, but type & (ampersand) after it, before you press <Enter>. This tells the UNIX system you want the command to run in the background, so it immediately returns your prompt.

For example, if you have a lot of files to join together, or if the files are large, you can put the command in the background:

cat bigfile1 bigfile2 bigfile3 > bigfil

`echo "this is a new line" >> file.txt`

When used with the -e option the echo command interprets the backslash-escaped characters such as newline \n:

`echo -e "this is a new line \nthis is another new line" >> file.txt`

`printf "Hello, I'm %s.\n" $USER >> file.txt`

`date +"Year: %Y, Month: %m, Day: %d" >> file.txt`

`echo "this is a new line"  | tee -a file.txt`

If you don’t want tee to write to the standard output, redirect it to /dev/null:

`echo "this is a new line"  | tee -a file.txt >/dev/null`

## SSH Auth

1.) on local comp (client) generate a key pair

PuttyGen
OpenSSH-keygen
ssh-keygen

The password (passphrase) encrypts the private key only.

A passphrase is an optional addition. If you enter one, you will have to provide it every time you use this key (unless you are running SSH agent software that stores the decrypted key). We recommend using a passphrase, but if you do not want to set a passphrase, you can simply press ENTER to bypass this prompt.

2) copy public key to the server.

Instructions ([here](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/51160-passwordless-ssh-login/))

      1) If necessary, generate an SSH key on your Mac or Linux machines, using ssh-keygen.

      2) Create an authorized_keys file for the unRAID server, using the id_rsa.pub files on all the machines which require access.

      3) Copy this file to your server's /root/.ssh/ folder.
      

      

This will work until a reboot. To handle a persistent setup:

      1) Copy the authorized_keys file to /boot/config/ssh/.
      2) Add this to the end of.your /boot/config/go, using your preferred editor:
      
                  mkdir /root/.ssh
                  chmod 700 /root/.ssh
                  cp /boot/config/ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/
                  chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
                  

Alternative Instructions

1. Create a script /boot/config/ssh/setup_ssh_client.sh:

            #!/bin/bash

            SSH_DIR=/root/.ssh

            mkdir ${SSH_DIR}
            chmod 755 ${SSH_DIR}
            cp /boot/config/ssh/authorized_keys ${SSH_DIR}/authorized_keys
            chmod 600 ${SSH_DIR}/authorized_keys
            

      and make it executable:
            
            chmod 755 /boot/config/ssh/setup_ssh_client.sh



2. Copy the previously created authorized_keys into /boot/config/ssh folder


       cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /boot/config/ssh/

 

3. Edit /boot/config/go and add the following line at the end, so that our setup script can be called during reboot:

 

    /boot/config/ssh/setup_ssh_client.sh

 
Still needing pw

Tried:
chmod -R -v g-rwx,o-rwx /root/.ssh



## Making the options persistant


### Append to file and write to stdout

 echo 'this is a test' | tee /dev/tty | tee >> test.txt

 actually this works easier

 echo '4' | tee -a test.txt


 ## Make the GUI The default view locally

Edit `/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg`
Add the line `menu default` to the desired entry.

`choose-client` [-t target-window] [template]
Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list. After a client is chosen, '%%' is replaced by the client pty(4) path in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used. This command works only from inside tmux.

`choose-session` [-t target-window] [template]
Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may be selected interactively from a list. When one is chosen, '%%' is replaced by the session name in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used. This command works only from inside tmux.

`choose-window` [-t target-window] [template]
Put a window into window choice mode, where a window may be chosen interactively from a list. After a window is selected, '%%' is replaced by the session name and window index in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, "select-window -t '%%'" is used. This command works only from inside tmux.

`display-panes `[-t target-client]
(alias: displayp) Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client. See the display-panes-time, display-panes-colour, and display-panes-active-colour session options. While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be selected with the '0' to '9' keys.

`find-window` [-t target-window] match-string
(alias: findw) Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern match-string in window names, titles, and visible content (but not history). If only one window is matched, it'll be automatically selected, otherwise a choice list is shown. This command only works from inside tmux.

`join-pane` [-dhv] [
-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
(alias: `joinp`) Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the space. This can be used to reverse break-pane.

`kill-pane` [-a] [-t target-pane]
(alias: `killp`) Destroy the given pane. If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed. The -a option kills all but the pane given with -t.

`kill-window` [-t target-window]
(alias: `killw`) Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing it from any sessions to which it is linked.

`last-pane` [-t target-window]
(alias: `lastp`) Select the last (previously selected) pane.

`last-window` [-t target-session]
(alias: `last`) Select the last (previously selected) window. If no target-session is specified, select the last window of the current session.

`link-window `[-dk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
(alias: `linkw`) Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window. If dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the src-window is linked there. If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is killed, otherwise an error is generated. If -d is given, the newly linked window is not selected.

`list-panes` [-as] [-t target]
(alias: `lsp`) If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed. If -s is given, target is a session (or the current session). If neither is given, target is a window (or the current window).

`list-windows` [-a] [-t target-session]
(alias: `lsw`) If -a is given, list all windows on the server. Otherwise, list windows in the current session or in target-session.

`move-window` [-dk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
(alias: `movew`) This is similar to link-window, except the window at src-window is moved to dst-window.

`new-window` [-adkP] [-n window-name] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
(alias: `neww`) Create a new window. With -a, the new window is inserted at the next index up from the specified target-window, moving windows up if necessary, otherwise target-window is the new window location.

If -d is given, the session does not make the new window the current window. target-window represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error is shown, unless the -k flag is used, in which case it is destroyed. shell-command is the command to execute. If shell-command is not specified, the value of the default-command option is used.

When the shell command completes, the window closes. See the remain-on-exit option to change this behaviour.

The TERM environment variable must be set to ''screen'' for all programs running inside tmux. New windows will automatically have ''TERM=screen'' added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.

The -P option prints the location of the new window after it has been created.

`next-layout` [-t target-window]
(alias: `nextl`) Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

`next-window` [-a] [-t target-session]
(alias: `next`) Move to the next window in the session. If -a is used, move to the next window with a bell, activity or content alert.

`pipe-pane` [-o] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
(alias: `pipep`) Pipe any output sent by the program in target-pane to a shell command. A pane may only be piped to one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed before shell-command is executed. The shell-command string may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left option. If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

The -o option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

`bind-key` C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat >>~/output.#I-#P' 

      `previous-layout `[-t target-window]

(alias: `prevl`) Move to the previous layout in the session.

`previous-window` [-a] [-t target-session]
(alias: `prev`) Move to the previous window in the session. With -a, move to the previous window with a bell, activity or content alert.

`rename-window` [-t target-window] new-name
(alias: `renamew`) Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if specified, to new-name.

`resize-pane` [-DLRU] [-t target-pane] [adjustment]
(alias: `resizep`) Resize a pane, upward with -U (the default), downward with -D, to the left with -L and to the right with -R. The adjustment is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).

`respawn-pane` [-k] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
(alias: `respawnp`) Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not given, the command used when the pane was created is executed. The pane must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.

`respawn-window` [-k] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
(alias: `respawnw`) Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not given, the command used when the window was created is executed. The window must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.

`rotate-window` [-DU] [-t target-window]
(alias: `rotatew`) Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically lower) with -U or downward (numerically higher).

`select-layout` [-np] [-t target-window] [layout-name]
(alias: `selectl`) Choose a specific layout for a window. If layout-name is not given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied. -n and -p are equivalent to the next-layout and previous-layout commands.

`select-pane` [-lDLRU] [-t target-pane]
(alias: `selectp`) Make pane target-pane the active pane in window target-window. If one of -D, -L, -R, or -U is used, respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used. -l is the same as using the last-pane command.

`select-window` [-lnp] [-t target-window]
(alias: `selectw`) Select the window at target-window. -l, -n and -p are equivalent to the last-window, next-window and previous-window commands.

`split-window` [-dhvP] [
-l size | -p percentage] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
(alias: `splitw`) Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a horizontal split and -v a vertical split; if neither is specified, -v is assumed. The -l and -p options specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage, respectively. All other options have the same meaning as for the new-window command.

`swap-pane` [-dDU] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
(alias: `swapp`) Swap two panes. If -U is used and no source pane is specified with -s, dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); -D swaps with the next pane (after it numerically). -d instructs tmux not to change the active pane.

`swap-window` [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
(alias: `swapw`) This is similar to link-window, except the source and destination windows are swapped. It is an error if no window exists at src-window.

`unlink-window`[-k] [-t target-window]
(alias: `unlinkw`) Unlink target-window. Unless -k is given, a window may be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may not be linked to no sessions; if -k is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed. 

## Backup and Sync

### Sync all the files 

rsync -rlthP --stats SRC /mnt/disks/Elements/ DEST .
rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --exclude '__Huge/*' --dry-run  /mnt/disks/Seagate_Expansion_Drive  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Seagate_Expansion_Drive
`rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --exclude '__Huge/*' /mnt/disks/Seagate_Expansion_Drive  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Seagate_Expansion_Drive`

`rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --exclude '__Huge/*' --exclude 'X\ backup*'  /mnt/disks/Elements/  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Elements/`

`rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --del  /mnt/disks/Elements/  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Elements/`


### Backup Restore using tar command

[Source](https://www.adminschoice.com/backup-commands-examples)



tar features:
1. tar ( tape  archive ) is used for single or multiple files backup and restore on/from  a tape or file.
2. tar can not backup special character & block device files , shows as 0 byte files with first letter of permissions as b or c for block or character.
3. tar Works only on mounted file system, it can not access the files on unmounted file system.

Backing up all files in a directory including subdirectories to a  tape device (/dev/rmt/0) or a file.


Example 1 :

            $tar    cvf    /dev/rmt/0   *

In the command above Options are  c -> create ; v -> Verbose ; f->file or archive device   ; * -> all files and directories . Together the commands means create a tar file on /dev/rmt/0 from all file and directories s in the current directory.

Example 2:

            $tar cvf /home/backup *

Create a tar  called backup in home directory , from all file and directories s in the current directory.

Viewing a tar backup on a tape or file
t option is used to see the table of content in a tar file.

            $tar    tvf    /dev/rmt/0  ## view files  backed up on a tape device.

            $tar tvf  /home/backup  ## view files  backed up inside the  backup

In the command above Options are  c -> create ; v -> Verbose ; f->file or archive device   ; * -> all files and directories . Together the commands means create a tar file on /dev/rmt/0 from all file and directories s in the current directory.

Extracting tar backup from the tape
x option is used to extract the files from tar file.

            $tar xvf /dev/rmt/0       ##extract /  restore files in to current directory.

            $tar xvf /home/backup ## extract / restore files in to current directory.

Note : Restoration will go to present directory or original backup path depending on
relative or absolute path names used for backup.

Some of useful tar options. 

Extract & keep the  file permissions (default for superuser)

            -p, –preserve-permissions

Filter the archive through gzip

            -z, –gzip

Filter the archive through bzip2

            -j, –bzip2

Only append files newer than copy in archive

            -u, –update

Append files to the end of an archive

            -r, –append

Delete from the archive (not on mag tapes!)

            –delete

Find differences between archive and file system
            
            -d, –diff, –compare

Test the archive volume label and exit

            –test-label

Change to directory DIR

            -C, –directory=DIR

## List the IP Addresses


`ip addr show |grep inet`t

## Finding Files


for directories visibility use:

```
find /mnt/user -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
```
 
and for files within a directory use:

```
find /mnt/user -type f -exec chmod 700 {} \;
```

            Commands marked with * may be preceded by a number, N.
            Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if N is given.
            A key preceded by a caret indicates the Ctrl key; thus ^K is ctrl-K.

                  ---------------------------------------------------
                  Default "window" is the screen height.
                  Default "half-window" is half of the screen height.

                  ^N or !  Search for NON-matching lines.
                  ^E or *  Search multiple files (pass thru END OF FILE).
                  ^F or @  Start search at FIRST file (for /) or last file (for ?).
                  ^K       Highlight matches, but don't move (KEEP position).
                  ^R       Don't use REGULAR EXPRESSIONS.

check that I match these params.  It looks like D and M are most common.  Rarely more than one.  SATA (without RAID, AHCI mode), SATA (without RAID, IDE enhance mode).

I can only do one at a time.

## Backups


### Stop Docker:

      docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
 
the -a switch lists all containers while without the -a only lists running containers.

!!!Question can I use this to restart those dockers?

## Notifications



```
/usr/local/sbin/notify -i normal -s "Appdata Backup Completed" -d " Appdata Backup completed at `date`"
```



## at command

This also works

      (sleep 10 ; echo "test" > ./testfile ) &
      (sleep 5 ; echo 'test\n' ) > /dev/stdout 2>&1  &
      (sleep 10 ; cat /boot/config/bashcustom >> /root/.bash_profile; echo "done")>/dev/stdout &
      (sleep 10 ; cat /boot/config/bashcustom >> /root/.bash_profile; source ~/.bash_profile; echo "done")>/dev/stdout &
for multiple commands using a file and at is better

The & makes it detach into the background
The parentheses makes sure they run together.

at


- `at` - executes commands at a specified time.
- `atq` - lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser; in that case, everybody's jobs are listed. The format of the output lines (one for each job) is: job number, date, hour, year, queue, and username.
- `atrm` - deletes jobs, identified by their job number.
- `batch` - executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops below 1.5, or the value specified in the invocation of atd.
