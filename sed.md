## FILE SPACING:

 double space a file
		sed G

**double space a file which already has blank lines in it.** 

   Output file # should contain no more than one blank line between lines of text.
	
   	sed '/^$/d;G'

**triple space a file**

		sed 'G;G'

**undo double-spacing (assumes** even-numbered lines are always blank)

		sed 'n;d'

**insert a blank line above every line which matches "regex"**

		sed '/regex/{x;p;x;}'

**insert a blank line below every line which matches "regex"**

		sed '/regex/G'

**insert a blank line above and below every line which matches "regex"**

		sed '/regex/{x;p;x;G;}'

NUMBERING:

**number each line of a file (simple left alignment).**
   
   Using a tab (see note on '\t' at end of file) instead of space will preserve margins.

		sed = filename | sed 'N;s/\n/\t/'

**number each line of a file**

  (number on left, right-aligned)
  
		sed = filename | sed 'N; s/^/     /; s/ *\(.\{6,\}\)\n/\1  /'

**number each _(non-blank)_ line of file**

		sed '/./=' filename | sed '/./N; s/\n/ /'

**count lines (emulates "wc -l")**

		sed -n '$='

## TEXT CONVERSION AND SUBSTITUTION:

**IN UNIX ENVIRONMENT: convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format.**

		sed 's/.$//'               # assumes that all lines end with CR/LF
		sed 's/^M$//'              # in bash/tcsh, press Ctrl-V then Ctrl-M
		sed 's/\x0D$//'            # works on ssed, gsed 3.02.80 or higher

**IN UNIX ENVIRONMENT: convert Unix newlines (LF) to DOS format.**

		sed "s/$/`echo -e \\\r`/"            # command line under ksh
		sed 's/$'"/`echo \\\r`/"             # command line under bash
		sed "s/$/`echo \\\r`/"               # command line under zsh
		sed 's/$/\r/'                        # gsed 3.02.80 or higher

**IN DOS ENVIRONMENT: convert Unix newlines (LF) to DOS format.**

		sed "s/$//"                          # method 1
		sed -n p                             # method 2

**IN DOS ENVIRONMENT: convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format.**

Can only be done with UnxUtils sed, version 4.0.7 or higher. The UnxUtils version can be identified by the custom "--text" switch which appears when you use the "--help" switch. Otherwise, changing DOS newlines to Unix newlines cannot be done with sed in a DOS environment. Use "`tr`" instead.

		sed "s/\r//" infile >outfile         # UnxUtils sed v4.0.7 or higher
		tr -d \r <infile >outfile            # GNU tr version 1.22 or higher

**delete leading whitespace **

 Removes (spaces, tabs) from front of each line aligns all text flush left
		sed 's/^[ \t]*//'                    # see note on '\t' at end of file

**delete trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs) from end of each line**

		sed 's/[ \t]*$//'                    # see note on '\t' at end of file

**delete BOTH leading and trailing whitespace from each line**

		sed 's/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//'

**insert 5 blank spaces at beginning of each line (make page offset)**

		sed 's/^/     /'

**align all text flush right on a 79-column width**

		sed -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,78\}$/ &/;ta'  # set at 78 plus 1 space

**center all text in the middle of 79-column width. **

 
 In method 1, spaces at the beginning of the line are significant, and trailing spaces are appended at the end of the line. In method 2, spaces at the beginning of the line are discarded in centering the line, and no trailing spaces appear at the end of lines.

		sed  -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,77\}$/ & /;ta'                     # method 1
		sed  -e :a -e 's/^.\{1,77\}$/ &/;ta' -e 's/\( *\)\1/\1/'  # method 2

**substitute (find and replace) "foo" with "bar" on each line**

		sed 's/foo/bar/'             # replaces only 1st instance in a line
		sed 's/foo/bar/4'            # replaces only 4th instance in a line
		sed 's/foo/bar/g'            # replaces ALL instances in a line
		sed 's/\(.*\)foo\(.*foo\)/\1bar\2/' # replace the next-to-last case
		sed 's/\(.*\)foo/\1bar/'            # replace only the last case

**substitute "foo" with "bar" ONLY for lines which contain "baz"**

		sed '/baz/s/foo/bar/g'

**substitute "foo" with "bar" EXCEPT for lines which contain "baz"**

		sed '/baz/!s/foo/bar/g'

**change "scarlet" or "ruby" or "puce" to "red"**

		sed 's/scarlet/red/g;s/ruby/red/g;s/puce/red/g'   # most seds
		gsed 's/scarlet\|ruby\|puce/red/g'                # GNU sed only

**reverse order of lines (emulates "tac")**

   bug/feature in HHsed v1.5 causes blank lines to be deleted

		sed '1!G;h;$!d'               # method 1
		sed -n '1!G;h;$p'             # method 2

**reverse each character on the line (emulates "rev")**

		sed '/\n/!G;s/\(.\)\(.*\n\)/&\2\1/;//D;s/.//'

**join pairs of lines side-by-side (like "paste")**

		sed '$!N;s/\n/ /'

**if a line ends with a backslash, append the next line to it**

		sed -e :a -e '/\\$/N; s/\\\n//; ta'

**if a line begins with an equal sign, append it to the previous line and replace the "=" with a single space**

		sed -e :a -e '$!N;s/\n=/ /;ta' -e 'P;D'

**add commas to numeric strings, changing "1234567" to "1,234,567"**

		gsed ':a;s/\B[0-9]\{3\}\>/,&/;ta'                     # GNU sed
		sed -e :a -e 's/\(.*[0-9]\)\([0-9]\{3\}\)/\1,\2/;ta'  # other seds

**add commas to numbers with decimal points and minus signs (GNU sed)**

		gsed -r ':a;s/(^|[^0-9.])([0-9]+)([0-9]{3})/\1\2,\3/g;ta'

**add a blank line every 5 lines (after lines 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.)**

		gsed '0~5G'                  # GNU sed only
		sed 'n;n;n;n;G;'             # other seds

**delete the last line of each paragraph**

		sed -n '/^$/{p;h;};/./{x;/./p;}'

### SPECIAL APPLICATIONS:

**remove nroff overstrikes (char, backspace) from man pages.**

 The 'echo' command may need an -e switch if you use Unix System V or bash shell.

		sed "s/.`echo \\\b`//g"    # double quotes required for Unix environment
		sed 's/.^H//g'             # in bash/tcsh, press Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-H
		sed 's/.\x08//g'           # hex expression for sed 1.5, GNU sed, ssed

**get Usenet/e-mail message header**

		sed '/^$/q'                # deletes everything after first blank line

**get Usenet/e-mail message body**

		sed '1,/^$/d'              # deletes everything up to first blank line

**get Subject header, but remove initial "Subject: " portion**

		sed '/^Subject: */!d; s///;q'

**get return address header**

		sed '/^Reply-To:/q; /^From:/h; /./d;g;q'

**parse out the address proper. **

 
   Pulls out the e-mail address by itself from the 1-line return address header (see preceding script)

		sed 's/ *(.*)//; s/>.*//; s/.*[:<] *//'

**add a leading angle bracket and space to each line (quote a message)**

		sed 's/^/> /'

**delete leading angle bracket & space from each line (unquote a message)**

		sed 's/^> //'

**remove most HTML tags (accommodates multiple-line tags)**

		sed -e :a -e 's/<[^>]*>//g;/</N;//ba'

extract multi-part uuencoded binaries, removing extraneous header info, so that only the uuencoded portion remains. Files passed to sed must be passed in the proper order. Version 1 can be entered from the command line; version 2 can be made into an executable Unix shell script. (Modified from a script by Rahul Dhesi.)

		sed '/^end/,/^begin/d' file1 file2 ... fileX | uudecode   # vers. 1
		sed '/^end/,/^begin/d' "$@" | uudecode                    # vers. 2

**sort paragraphs of file alphabetically**

 
 Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. GNU sed uses \v for vertical tab, or any unique char will do.

		sed '/./{H;d;};x;s/\n/={NL}=/g' file | sort | sed '1s/={NL}=//;s/={NL}=/\n/g'
		gsed '/./{H;d};x;y/\n/\v/' file | sort | sed '1s/\v//;y/\v/\n/'

**zip up each .TXT file individually**

 
   ...deleting the source file and setting the name of each .ZIP file to the basename of the .TXT file  (under DOS: the "dir /b" switch returns bare filenames in all caps).

		echo @echo off >zipup.bat
		dir /b *.txt | sed "s/^\(.*\)\.TXT/pkzip -mo \1 \1.TXT/" >>zipup.bat

## TYPICAL USE: 

 Sed takes one or more editing commands and applies all of
them, in sequence, to each line of input. After all the commands have
been applied to the first input line, that line is output and a second
input line is taken for processing, and the cycle repeats. The
preceding examples assume that input comes from the standard input
device (i.e, the console, normally this will be piped input). One or
more filenames can be appended to the command line if the input does
not come from stdin. Output is sent to stdout (the screen). Thus:

		cat filename | sed '10q'        # uses piped input
		sed '10q' filename              # same effect, avoids a useless "cat"
		sed '10q' filename > newfile    # redirects output to disk

For additional syntax instructions, including the way to apply editing
commands from a disk file instead of the command line, consult "sed &
awk, 2nd Edition," by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins (O'Reilly,
1997; http://www.ora.com), "UNIX Text Processing," by Dale Dougherty
and Tim O'Reilly (Hayden Books, 1987) or the tutorials by Mike Arst
distributed in U-SEDIT2.ZIP (many sites). To fully exploit the power
of sed, one must understand "regular expressions." For this, see
"Mastering Regular Expressions" by Jeffrey Friedl (O'Reilly, 1997).
The manual ("man") pages on Unix systems may be helpful (try "man
sed", "man regexp", or the subsection on regular expressions in "man
ed"), but man pages are notoriously difficult. They are not written to
teach sed use or regexps to first-time users, but as a reference text
for those already acquainted with these tools.

QUOTING SYNTAX: The preceding examples use single quotes ('...')
instead of double quotes ("...") to enclose editing commands, since
sed is typically used on a Unix platform. Single quotes prevent the
Unix shell from intrepreting the dollar sign ($) and backquotes
(`...`), which are expanded by the shell if they are enclosed in
double quotes. Users of the "csh" shell and derivatives will also need
to quote the exclamation mark (!) with the backslash (i.e., \!) to
properly run the examples listed above, even within single quotes.
Versions of sed written for DOS invariably require double quotes
("...") instead of single quotes to enclose editing commands.

USE OF '\t' IN SED SCRIPTS: For clarity in documentation, we have used
the expression '\t' to indicate a tab character (0x09) in the scripts.
However, most versions of sed do not recognize the '\t' abbreviation,
so when typing these scripts from the command line, you should press
the TAB key instead. '\t' is supported as a regular expression
metacharacter in awk, perl, and HHsed, sedmod, and GNU sed v3.02.80.

VERSIONS OF SED: Versions of sed do differ, and some slight syntax
variation is to be expected. In particular, most do not support the
use of labels (:name) or branch instructions (b,t) within editing
commands, except at the end of those commands. We have used the syntax
which will be portable to most users of sed, even though the popular
GNU versions of sed allow a more succinct syntax. When the reader sees
a fairly long command such as this:

		  sed -e '/AAA/b' -e '/BBB/b' -e '/CCC/b' -e d

it is heartening to know that GNU sed will let you reduce it to:

		  sed '/AAA/b;/BBB/b;/CCC/b;d'      # or even
		  sed '/AAA\|BBB\|CCC/b;d'

In addition, remember that while many versions of sed accept a command
like "/one/ s/RE1/RE2/", some do NOT allow "/one/! s/RE1/RE2/", which
contains space before the 's'. Omit the space when typing the command.

OPTIMIZING FOR SPEED: If execution speed needs to be increased (due to
large input files or slow processors or hard disks), substitution will
be executed more quickly if the "find" expression is specified before
giving the "s/.../.../" instruction. Thus:

		  sed 's/foo/bar/g' filename         # standard replace command
		  sed '/foo/ s/foo/bar/g' filename   # executes more quickly
		  sed '/foo/ s//bar/g' filename      # shorthand sed syntax

On line selection or deletion in which you only need to output lines
from the first part of the file, a "quit" command (q) in the script
will drastically reduce processing time for large files. Thus:

		  sed -n '45,50p' filename           # print line nos. 45-50 of a file
		  sed -n '51q;45,50p' filename       # same, but executes much faster

perform command everywhere EXCEPT lines [n] to [m]

		sed [n],[m]![command]

repeat command every [r] lines starting at [n]

		sed [n]~[r][command]

apply multiple statements to address range by grouping with '{' and '}'

		sed '[n]{[statement];[statement]}'
		sed '[n],[m]{[statement];[statement]}'

examples
substitution
replace first a with b

		sed 's:a:b:'

replace all a's with b's

		sed 's:a:b:g'

replace first character (any) with an x

		sed 's:.:x:'

replace first literal dot '.' with x

		sed 's:\.:x:'

replace first zero or more a's with a single b

		sed 's:a*:b:'

replace first digit with an x

		sed 's:[0-9]:x:'

replace the numbers 2,3,6 & 7 with an x

		sed    's/[2-36-7]/x/'
		sed    's/[2-3]\|[6-7]/x/'
		sed -r 's/[2-3]|[6-7]/x/'

replace numbers of at least 3 digits with xxx

		sed    's/[0-9]\{3,\}/xxx/g'
		sed -r 's/[0-9]{3,}/xxx/g'

replace tabs with 4 spaces

		sed 's/\t/    /'

end path with sindle trailing slash

		sed -e 's:/*$:/:'

increment numbers

		sed    's/[0-9]\+/expr 1 + &/e'
		sed -r 's/[0-9]+/expr 1 + &/e'

capturing
keep only the first character

		sed    's:\(.\).\+:\1:'
		sed -r 's:(.).+:\1:'

swap the first 2 characters

		sed    's:\(.\)\(.\):\2\1:'
		sed -r 's:(.)(.):\2\1:'

capture entire line with ampersand (&)

seq 5 | sed 's/.*/& sucks/'

deleting
delete line number 2

		sed 2d

delete last line

		sed '$ d'

delete line 2 to 6

		sed 2,6d

delete line 2, 5, 8, 11, etc. (gnu extension)

		sed '2~3d'

keep line 2, delete the rest

		sed '2!d'

deleting blank lines

		sed '/^ *$/d' input.txt

delete any line containing a 0 or 5 and the 2 lines after it (gnu extension)

		sed '/[05]/,+2d'

delete first occurrence of foo

foo="bar"
		sed "1,/$foo/{/$foo/ d}"

insert
insert [text] at line #1 (and append the rest of the file)

		sed "1i[text]"

address ranges
extract chunk starting at pattern

		sed '/[pattern]/,$ d' [file]

extract chunk until pattern:

		sed '/[pattern]/q' [file]

extract chunk from pattern until pattern

		sed -n '/[pattern]/,/[pattern]/p' [file]

extract line numbers 120 to 140

		sed -n 120,140p [file]

use +[number] for m to specify lines relative to [n], example: extracting line 3 to 5

		sed -n '3,+2p' [file]

delete every other line

		sed 2~2d [file]

a dollar refers to the last line, example: counting new lines in file:

		sed -n "$=" [file]

perform multiple substitutions on line 1 to 3

		sed '1,3{s/apple/pear/;s/pineapple/banana/;/grapefruit/d}'

upper / lower case
upper case the first letter on every line

		sed 's/[a-z]/\u&/'

upper case the first word on every line

		sed 's/\w\+/\U&/'

repeat line upper case, input case and finally lower case

		sed 's/.*/\U& \E& \L&/'
