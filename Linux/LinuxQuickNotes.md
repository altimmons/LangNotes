### UNIX HELP
- `man` - general help
- `man wc` - manual on program 'word count' wc
- `wc --help` - short help on wc
- `info wc` - more detailed information system (GNU)
- `apropos wc` - retrieves pages where wc appears


## Tools
-   openÂ [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

-   [Setup for graphics emulation](http://kansas.ucr.edu/gcg/gcg_simple.html)

-   [WinSCP for file exchange](http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/)


WGET (file download from the www)
- `wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih....` - file download from www; add option '-r' to download entire directories
SCP (secure copy between machines)
General syntax
- `scp source target` - Use form 'userid@machine_name' if your local and remote user ids are differnt. If they are the same you can use only 'machine_name'.

Examples
Copy file from Server to Local Machine (type from local machine prompt):
- `scp user@remote_host:file.name .` - '.' copies to pwd, you can specify here any directory, use wildcards to copy many files at once.
Copy file from Local Machine to Server:
- `scp file.name user@remote_host:~/dir/newfile.name` - Copy entire directory from Server to Local Machine (type from local machine prompt):
- `scp -r user@remote_host:directory/ ~/dir` - Copy entire directory from Local Machine to Server (type from local machine prompt):
- `scp -r directory/ user@remote_host:directory/` - Copy between two remote hosts (e.g. from bioinfo to cache):
similar as above, just be logged in one of the remote hosts:
-  `scp -r directory/ user@remote_host:directory/`

NICE FTP

- `open ncftp`
- `ncftp> open ftp.ncbi.nih.gov`
- `ncftp> cd /blast/executables`
- `ncftp> get blast.linux.tar.Z (skip extension: @)`
- `ncftp> bye`

## Basics

`ssh <user_name>@<host name(IP)>`

- `.` - refers to pwd
- `~/` - refers to user's home directory
- `history` - shows all commands you have used recently
- `!<number>` - starts an old command by providing its ID number
- `up(down)_key` - scrolls through command history
- `<incomplete path/file_name> TAB` - completes path/file_name
- `<incomplete command> SHIFT&TAB` - completes command
- `Ctrl a` - cursor to beginning of command line
- `Ctrl e` - cursor to end of command line
- `Ctrl d` - delete character under cursor
- `Ctrl k` - delete line from cursor, content goes into kill buffer
- `Ctrl y` - paste content from Ctrl k
- `Ctrl + w`  erase word
-  `Ctrl u` erase from here to beginning of the line 
- `Ctrl z`  send to background
- [[Ctrl]] + [[r]] (`^r) enters history search mode.
- `^` correct the last line   `^error^correction`
        	1. $ vi /etc/Somefile.conf #(oops!) 
	        2. $ ^f^F 
            # Which bash turns into:
        	3. $ vi /etc/SomeFile.conf
`&` as in `./script.sh &` send to bg
`fg <#>` reenter job (#)
`bg <#>` background job (#)
`job` list jobs


## Cmd line
`!!` -repeat the last line (entirely)
`!xyz` - Repeats the last line that started with xyz
`!xyz:p` using `:p`  at the end prints the history command rather than executing it/
`history` gets a list of the history
`!N` brings the Nth entry in history.
    - `!-2` - two commands ago
    - `!2` - the second command.
`!$` is the "end" of the previous command eg the last argument.
`!*` is all of the arguments to the previous command rather than just the last one. 

### Brace Expansion
Uses curly braces `{}` to expand items.
`cp filename{,-old} ` --> `cp filename filename-old`
cp filename{-old,}  --> cp filename-old, filename
`cp filename{-v1,-v2}` --> cp filename{-v1,-v2} 
`touch a{1,2,3}b`  -->  create three files called a1b, a2b and a3b
`touch {p2,pv,av,}p ` , creating p2p, pvp, avp and simply p
`ls /usr/{,local/}{,s}bin/jojo `
        $ ls /usr/bin/jojo /usr/sbin/jojo /usr/local/bin/jojo /usr/local/sbin/jojo

` apt-get remove --purge ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}` 
            . $ apt-get remove --purge ppp pppconfig pppoe pppoeconf 

### Colon notation:

- `:p` print the command
- `:s`Substitution similar to `^x^X`
    - modifies the previous command, substituting the first argument to :s with the second argument to :s
        - `:g` If you want to affect every instance of the substitution string, you must use the :g word modifier along with :s.

                    1. $ mroe file1 ; mroe file2 
                    $ !!:gs/mroe/more 
        - `&` calls back the first arg to `:s`'

                1. $ ls -lh myfile otherfile anotherfile 
                  $ !!:s/myfile/&.old/ 

- `:h` Remove a trailing file name component, leaving only the head.
- `:t` - Remove all leading file name components, leaving the tail.
- `:r` - Remove a trailing suffix of the form .xxx, leaving the basename.
- `:e` - Remove all but the trailing suffix. 


Examples:

	1. $ wget http://www.example.com/path/to/jubby.tgz 
	2. $ tar tzvf jubby.tgz 
	3. [output] 
$ mkdir !$:r 
Take the last command argument, jubby.tgz, strip the .tgz. and make a directory/


	    1. $ links /usr/local/share/doc/3dm/3DM_help.html 
        2. $ cd !$:h  
        #cd to !$ or the last argument of the previous command, :h  trims off the file name portion of the string, leaving just the directory.
         $ links !-2$:t  
         # run links using the last argument of the command preceding the most recent one, trimming the path from that argument, or links 3DM_help.html. N


	1. $ cd /tmp 
	2. $ wget http://www.example.com/path/KickassApplicationSuite.tar.gz 
	3. $ cd /usr/local/src/ 
	4. $ mkdir !-2$:t:r:r 
	5. {creates directory called 'KickassApplicationSuite'} 
	6. $ cd !$ 
$ tar xvzf /tmp/!-4$:t 


### Functions and Braces

{0} - current env
{1} first positional
{2}     second positional
{N} 
{FUNCNAME} returns the function name thats running
{#} the number of args received.
{?} the current return code that will be returned if you exit now.
{*} all arguments.
### Orientation

- `pwd` - present working directory
- `ls` - content of pwd
- `ll` - similar as ls, but provides additional info on files and `rectories
- `ll -a` - includes hidden files (.name) as well
- `ll -R` - lists subdirectories recursively
- `ll -t` - lists files in chronological order
- `stat <file_name>` - provides all attributes of a file
- `whoami` - shows as who you are logged in
- `hostname` - shows on which machine you are
- `who` - shows who is logged into system
- `w` - shows which users are logged into system and what they are doing


## Files and directories

- `mkdir <dir_name>` - creates specified directory
- `cd <dir_name>` - switches into specified directory
- `cd ..` - moves one directory up
- `cd ../../` - moves two directories up (and so on)
- `cd` - brings you to highest level of your home directory
- `rmdir <dir_name>` - removes empty directory
- `rm <file_name>` - removes file name
- `rm -r <dir_name>` - removes directory including its content, but asks for confirmation, 'f' argument turns confirmation off
- `mv <name1> <name2>` - renames directories or files
- `mv <name> <path>` - moves file/directory as specified in path
- `cp <name> <path>` - copy file/directory as specified in path (-r to include content in directories)



### ARCHIVING AND COMPRESSING

Archiving and compressing
- `tar -cvf my_file.tar mydir/` - Builds tar archive of files or directories. For directories, execute command in parent directory. Don't use absolute path.
- `tar -czvf my_file.tgz mydir/` - Builds tar archive with compression of files or directories. For directories, execute command in parent directory. Don't use absolute path.
Viewing Archives
- `tar -tvf my_file.tar`
- `tar -tzvf my_file.tgz`
Extracting
- `tar -xvf my_file.tar`
- `tar -xzvf my_file.tgz`
- `gunzip my_file.tar.gz` - or unzip my_file.zip, uncompress my_file.Z, or bunzip2 for file.tar.bz2
- `find -name '*.zip' | xargs -n 1 unzip` - this command usually works for unziping many files that were compressed under Windows
try also:
- `tar zxf blast.linux.tar.Z`
- `tar xvzf file.tgz`
options:
f: use archive file
p: preserve permissions
v: list files processed
x: exclude files listed in FILE
z: filter the archive through gzip

## Shell

When you log into UNIX/LINUX the system starts a program called SHELL. It provides you with a working environment and interface to the operating system. Usually there are many different shell programs installed.
- `finger <user_name>` - shows which shell you are using
- `chsh -l` - gives list of shell programs available on your system (does not work on all UNIX variants)
- `<shell_name>` - switches to different shell

### STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, REDIRECTORS, OPERATORS & WILDCARDS (more on this @ LINUX HOWTOs)

By default, many UNIX commands read from standard input (STDIN) and send their output to standard out (STDOUT). You can redirect them by using the following commands:
- `file*` - * is wildcard to specify many files
- `ls > file` - prints ls output into specified file
- `command < my_file` - uses file after '<' as STDIN
- `command >> my_file` - appends output of one command to file
- `command | tee my_file` - writes STDOUT to file and prints it to screen; alternative way to do this:
- `command > my_file; cat my_file`
- `command > /dev/null` - turns off progress info of applications by redirecting their output to /dev/null
- `grep my_pattern my_file | wc` - Pipes (|) output of 'grep' into 'wc'
- `grep my_pattern my_non_existing_file 2 > my_stderr` - prints STDERR to file

- Useful shell commands
- `cat <file1> <file2> > <cat.out>` - concatenate files in output file 'cat.out'
- `paste <file1> <file2> > <paste.out>` - merges lines of files and separates them by tabs (useful for tables)
- `cmp <file1> <file2>` - tells you whether two files are identical
- `diff <fileA> <fileB>` - finds differences between two files
- `head -<number> <file>` - prints first lines of a file
- `tail -<number> <file>` - prints last lines of a file
- `split -l <number> <file>` - splits lines of file into many smaller ones
- `csplit -f out fasta_batch "%^>%" "/^>/" "{*}"` - splits fasta batch file into many files at '>'
- `sort <file>` - sorts single file, many files and can merge (-m) them, -b ignores leading white space, ...
- `sort -k 2,2 -k 3,3n input_file > output_file` - sorts in table column 2 alphabetically and column 3 numerically, '-k' for column, '-n' for numeric
- `sort input_file | uniq > output_file` - uniq command removes duplicates and creates file/table with unique lines/fields
- `join -1 1 -2 1 <table1> <table2>` - joins two tables based on specified column numbers (-1 file1, 1: col1; -2: file2, col2). It assumes that join fields are sorted. If that is not the case, use the next command:
- `sort table1 > table1a; sort table2 > table2a; join -a 1 -t "`echo -e '\t'`" table1a table2a > table3` - '-a <table>' prints all lines of specified table! Default prints only all lines the two tables have in common. '-t "`echo -e '\t'`" ->' forces join to use tabs as field separator in its output. Default is space(s)!!!
- `cat my_table | cut -d , -f1-3` - cut command prints only specified sections of a table, -d specifies here comma as column separator (tab is default), -f specifies column numbers.
- `grep and egrep` - see chapter 4

### Advanced Commands

- `cp filename{-v1,-v2}`- Uses brace expansion to add the endings to filename- eg filename-v1, filename-v2
`touch a{1,2,3}b `- a1b, a2b and a3b
- `touch {p2,pv,av,}p` = p2p, pvp, avp and simply p (the ending comma)
 - `ls /usr/{,local/}{,s}bin/jojo` =  *"ls /usr/bin/jojo /usr/sbin/jojo /usr/local/bin/jojo /usr/local/sbin/jojo"*
- ` apt-get remove --purge ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}` => `apt-get remove --purge ppp pppconfig pppoe pppoeconf `

## Find

### Finding files, directories and applications
- `find -name "*pattern*"` - searches for *pattern* in and below current directory
- `find /usr/local -name "*blast*"` - finds file names *blast* in specfied directory
- `find /usr/local -iname "*blast*"` - same as above, but case insensitive
additional useful arguments: -user <user name>, -group <group name>, -ctime <number of days ago changed>
- `find ~ -type f -mtime -2` - finds all files you have modified in the last two days
- `locate <pattern>` - finds files and dirs that are written into update file
- `which <application_name>` - location of application
- `whereis <application_name>` - searches for executeables in set of directories
- `dpkg -l | grep mypattern` - find Debian packages and refine search with grep pattern


### Finding things in files
- `grep pattern file` - provides lines in 'file' where pattern 'appears', if pattern is shell function use single-quotes: '>'
- `grep -H pattern` - -H prints out file name in front of pattern
- `grep 'pattern' file | wc` - pipes lines with pattern into word count wc (see chapter 8); wc arguments: -c: show only bytes, -w: show only words, -l: show only lines; help on regular expressions: $ man 7 regex or man perlre
- `find /home/my_dir -name '*.txt' | xargs grep -c ^.*` - counts line numbers on many files and records each count along with individual file name; find and xargs are used to circumvent the Linux wildcard limit to apply this function on thousands of files.

### Alternatives

alternatives --list


#### Create:

Requires elevation

Create an alternative for the original by providing:

-  **location** for the "generic" symlink, usually on path probably, and the fle name
-  *name* for the alternative - e.g. these are the "pyton_opts". *not the file name that is run, below that is `em`*
-  **binary** to be executed when these symlinks are called
-  **priority** level to indicate which alternative is preferred
    - **(higher is more , eg, a 2 runs over a 1, a 99 always runs)**
    
  alternatives **--(action-** install) **(location** of generic link) (ref_name)(target binary) (Priority num)

`sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/em uemacs /opt/em-legacy/em2 1`

#### Inspect

Requires elevation

`sudo alternatives --config uemacs` - where uemacs is the generic name here as an example.  For example py or python for python3.8

#### Remove 

` sudo alternatives --remove-all uemacs`

or to remove one, use the `--config` and then using the `Command` field which holds the path:
`sudo alternatives --remove uemacs /opt/em-legacy/em2`


## Admin


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

environment variables and should be defined in /etc or $HOME/.profile. like EDITOR and CC

- `xhost user@host` - adds X permissions for user on server.
- `echo DISPLAY` - shows current display settings
- `export (setenv) DISPLAY=<local_IP>:0` - change environment variable
- `unsetenv DISPLAY` - removes display variable
- `$PATH` - list of directories that the shell will search when you type a command
- You can edit your default DISPLAY setting for your account by adding it to file .bash_profile.
- `printenv` |  `env` | `export` - prints all environment variables
    - 

Here are some common environmental variables that you will come across:

### Common Ones

>- `SHELL`: This describes the shell--in most cases, this will be **bash** but other values can be set if you prefer other options.
>- `TERM`: This specifies the type of terminal to emulate when running the shell. Different hardware terminals can be emulated based on requirements.
>- `USER`: The current logged in **user.**
>- `PWD`: The *current working directory.*
>- `OLDPWD`: The *previous working directory.* This is kept by the shell in order to switch back by running `cd -`.
>- `LS_COLORS`: This defines color codes that are used to optionally add colored output to the ls command.
>- `MAIL`: The path to the current user's mailbox.
>- **`PATH`**: A list of directories that the system will check when looking for commands. When a user types in a command, the system will check directories in this order for the executable.
>- `LANG`: The current language and localization settings, including character encoding.
>- `HOME`: The current user's home directory.

`passwd` Changing password:

### Ownership

- '+' causes the permissions selected to be added
- '-' causes them to be removed
- '=' causes them to be the only permissions 
- octal bits `ugo`
    - users
    - group
    - others
- values are 3 bits, 
   -  4 read,
   -  2 write, 
   - 1 execute.

- `ls -al` - shows something like this for each file/dir: drwxrwxrwx
- d: directory
- rwx: read write execute

- `chmod ug+rx my_file` To assign write and execute permissions to user and group:

- `chmod ugo-rwx my_file` To remove all permissions from all three user groups:
that the file has.
Example for number system:
- `chmod +rx public_html/`
 $ chmod 755 public_html/



#### Change ownership

- `chown <user> <file or dir>` - changes user ownership
- `chgrp <group> <file or dir>` - changes group ownership
- `chown <user>:<group> <file or dir>` - changes user & group ownership




- `chown apache:developers test.php` -  Change ownership of test.php to âapacheâ and the âdevelopersâ group.
- `chmod u+rw,g+rw,o+r test.php` Change the mode of test.php to allow owner
(u) and users in the group (g) to read and write (+rw) it, and the rest of the world (o) to just read (+r) it.
- `chmod g+rw test.php` Allow users in the group of test.php to read
and write it
 - `chmod g+s /var/www/html` -  Special command to make sure that all files created in /var/www/html are owned by the group that own /var/
- `chmod 755 somescript`  Allow the owner of somescript to read,
write and execute it, and the rest of the world to just read and execute it.

        - `:#,#s/\( \{-} \|\.\|\n\)/\1/g` - performs simple word count in specified range of text
        - `:%s/\(E\{6,\}\)/<font color="green">\1<\/font>/g` - highlight pattern in html colors, here highlighting of >= 6 occurences of Es
        - `:%s/\([A-Z]\)/\l\1/g` - change uppercase to lowercase, '%s/\([A-Z]\)/\u\1/g' does the opposite
        - `:g/my_pattern/ s/\([A-Z]\)/\l\1/g | copy $` - uses 'global' command to apply replace function only on those lines that match a certain pattern. The 'copy $' command after the pipe '|' prints all matching lines at the end of the file.
        - `:args *.txt | all | argdo %s/\old_pat/new_pat/ge | update` - Command 'args' places all relevant files in the argument list (buffer); 'all' displays each file in separate split window; command 'argdo' applies replacement to all files in argument list (buffer); flag 'e' is necessary to avoid stop at error messages for files with no matches; command 'update' saves all changes to files that were updated.
    - MATCHING PARENTHESES SEARCH
        - place curser on (, [ or { and type % # curser moves to matching parentheses
    - HTML EDITING
        -Convert text file to html format:
        - `:runtime! syntax/2html.vim` - run this command with open file in Vim
        SHELL COMMAND IN VIM
        - `:!<SHELL_COMMAND> <ENTER>` - executes any shell command, hit <enter> to return
        - `:sh` - switches window to shell, 'exit' switches back to vim
        USING VIM AS TABLE EDITOR
        - `v` - starts visual mode for selecting characters
        - `V` - starts visual mode for selecting lines
        - `CTRL-V` - starts visual mode for selecting blocks (use CTRL-q in gVim under Windows). This allows column-wise selections and operations like inserting and deleting columns. To restrict substitude commands to a column, one can select it and switch to the command-line by typing ':'. After this the substitution sytax for a selected block looks like this: '<,'>s///.
        - `:set scrollbind` - starts simultaneous scrolling of 'vsplitted' files. To set to horizontal binding of files, use command ':set scrollopt=hor' (after first one). Run all these commands before the ':split' command.
        - `:AlignCtrl I= \t then :%Align` - This allows to align tables by column separators (here '\t') when the Align utility from Charles Campbell's is installed.
        To sort table rows by selected lines or block, perform the visual select and then hit F3 key. The rest is interactive. To enable this function one has to include in the .vimrc file from Gerald Lai the Vim sort script.
    - MODIFY VIM SETTINGS (in file .vimrc)
        - see last chapter of vimtutor (start from shell)
        - useful .vimrc sample
        - when vim starts to respond very slowly then one may need to delete the .viminf* files in home directory

## Script Ex

- `for i in *.input; do mv $i ${i/name\.old/name\.new}; done` - renames file name.old to name.new
- To test things first, insert 'echo' between 'do mv' (above).
- `for i in *.input; do ./application $i; done` - runs application in loops on many input files
- `for i in *.input; do fastacmd -d /data/../database_name -i $i > $i.out; done` - runs fastacmd in loops on many *.input files and creates *.out files
- `for i in *.pep; do target99 -db /usr/../database_name -seed $i -out $i; done` - runs SAM's target99 on many input files
- `for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do grep -iH <my_pattern> *$j.seq; done` - searches in > 10,000 files for pattern and prints occurences together with file names.
- `for i in *.pep; do echo -e "$i\n\n17\n33\n\n\n" | ./tmpred $i > $i.out; done` - example of how to run an interactive application (tmpred) that asks for file name input/output
- `for i in *.fasta1; do blast2 -p blastp -i $i -j ${i/_*fasta1/_*fasta2} >> my_out_file; done` - runs BLAST2 for all *.fasa1/*.fasta2 file pairs in the order specified by file names and writes results into one file. This example uses two variables in a for loop. The content of the second variable gets specified in each loop by a replace function.
- `for i in *.fasta; do for j in *.fasta; do blast2 -p blastp -F F -i $i -j $j >> my_out_file; done; done;` - runs BLAST2 in all-against-all mode and writes results into one file; '-F F' turns low-complexity filter off

### PERL
- `perl -p -i -w -e 's/pattern1/pattern2/g' input_file` - replace something (e.g. return signs) in file using regular expressions; use $1 to backreference to pattern placed in parentheses
    '-p' lets perl know to write program; '-i.bak' creates backup file *.bak, only -i doesn't; '-w' turns on warnings; '-e' executeable code follows
- `perl -ne 'print if (/my_pattern1/ ? ($c=1) : (--$c > 0)) ; print if (/my_pattern2/ ? ($d = 1) : (--$d > 0))' my_infile > my_outfile` - parses lines that contain pattern1 and pattern2

following lines after pattern can be specified in '$c=1' and '$d=1'; for OR function use this syntax: '/(pattern1|pattern2)/'

## Logic  

| `-b file ` | true if the file is a block special file  |
| `-c file ` | true if the file is a character special file  |
| `-d file ` | true if the file is a directory  |
| `-e file ` | true if the file exists  |
| `-f file ` | true if the file is an ordinary file  |
| `-g file ` | true if setgid attribute is ON(system attribute  on Windows)  |
| `-h file ` | true if file is a symbolic link  |
| `-k file ` | true if the save text attribute of the file is ON(archive attribute  on Windows)  |
| `-L file ` | true if file is a symbolic link  |
| `-n string ` | true if the length of string is greater than zero  |
| `-p file ` | true if the file is a FIFO (named pipe)  |
| `-r file ` | true if the file is readable  |
| `-s file ` | true if the size of the file is non-zero  |
| `-t fd ` | true if the numeric file descriptor fd is open and associated with a terminal  |
| `-u file ` | true if the setuid attribute is ON(hidden attribute on Windows)  |
| `-w file ` | true if the file is writable  |
| -x file  | true if the file is executable.  |
| -z string  | true if the length of the string is zero |

*1 If the specified file does not exist, test checks each extension in the PATHEXT environment variable (in the order listed) to see if a file exists with the specified name plus that extension. If such a file does exist and it is executable, -x returns true.


Integer COmparison

| -eq | number1 -eq number2  | true if number1 and number2 are equal |

Both number1 and number2 must be integers

| -ge | number1 -ge number2  | true if number1 is greater than or equal to number2 |
| -gt | number -gt number  | true if number1 is greater than number2 |
| -le | number1 -le number2  | true if the first number1 is less than or equal to number2 |
| -lt | number1 -lt number2  | true if number1 is less than number2 |
| -ne | number1 -ne number2  | true if number1 is not equal to number2 |
| -nt | file1 -nt file2  | true if file1 is newer than file2 *^2^|
| -ot | file1 -ot file2  | true if file1 is older than file2 |
| -ef | file1 -ef file2  | true if file1 has the same device and i-node number as file2 |

Note:
A nonexistent file is considered to be older than any existing file. In turn, no existing file is older than a nonexistent file. Two nonexistent files are considered the same age.

Using `[[ ]]`

string `==` pattern 
string `=` pattern - true if string matches pattern
string `!=` pattern  - true if string does not match pattern.
string1 < string2 true if string1 comes before string2 alphabetically.
string1 > string2 - true if string1 comes after string2 alphabetically.

The following operators allow you to combine other operators:

expr1 -a expr2 (test and [ commands) 
expr1 && expr2 ([[ command) 
logical AND; true if both expr1 and expr2 are true

expr1 -o expr2 (test and [ commands) 
expr1 || expr2 ([[ command) 
logical OR; true if either expr1 or expr2 is true

`! expr ` logical negation; true if expr is false

`( expr ) ` binding; true if expr is true

The precedence of the operators, in descending order, is:

parenthesized expressions
unary operators
comparison operators
logical AND
logical OR

The following operators handle string comparisons for the test and [ commands:

string 
true if string is not a null string

string1 = string2 
true if string1 and string2 are identical

string1 != string2 
true if string1 and string2 are not identical
Note:If the specified file does not exist, test checks each extension in the PATHEXT environment variable (in the order listed) to see if a file exists with the specified name plus that extension. If such a file does exist and it is executable, -x returns true.
