# Random Linux Stuff

## Apt Commands.

##  $## Apt get

 To list all the available packages,
 
		$ apt-cache pkgnames

To find out the package name and with it description before installing, use the ‘search‘ flag. Using “search” with apt-cache will display a list of matched packages with short description. Let’s say you would like to find out description of package ‘vsftpd‘, then command would be.

		$ apt-cache search vsftpd

To find and list down all the packages starting with ‘vsftpd‘, you could use the following command.

		$ apt-cache pkgnames vsftpd

vsttpd


3. Check Package Information?
For example, if you would like to check information of package along with it short description say (version number, check sums, size, installed size, category etc). Use ‘show‘ sub command as shown below.

        $ apt-cache show netcat

4.  **Check Dependencies for Specific Packages?**  the ‘showpkg‘ sub command checks the dependencies for particular software packages. whether those dependencies packages are installed or not. For example, use the `‘showpkg‘` command along with package-name.

            $ apt-cache showpkg vsftpd
            Package: vsftpd

1.  **I Check statistics of Cache**
The ‘stats‘ sub command will display overall statistics about the cache. For example, the following command will display Total package names is the number of packages have found in the cache.

6. How to **Update System Packages**
The ‘update‘ command is used to resynchronize the package index files from the their sources specified in /etc/apt/sources.list file. The update command fetched the packages from their locations and update the packages to newer version.

        $ sudo apt-get update

7. How to **Upgrade Software Packages**
The ‘upgrade‘ command is used to upgrade all the currently installed software packages on the system. Under any circumstances currently installed packages are not removed or packages which are not already installed neither retrieved and installed to satisfy upgrade dependencies.

However, if you want to upgrade, unconcerned of whether software packages will be added or removed to fulfill dependencies, use the ‘dist-upgrade‘ sub command.

		$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

8. How Do I Install or Upgrade Specific Packages?
The ‘install‘ sub command is tracked by one or more packages wish for installation or upgrading.

9. How I can Install Multiple Packages?
You can add more than one package name along with the command in order to install multiple packages at the same time. For example, the following command will install packages ‘nethogs‘ and ‘goaccess‘.

		$ sudo apt-get install nethogs goaccess

10. How to Install Several Packages using Wildcard
With the help of regular expression you can add several packages with one string. For example, we use * wildcard to install several packages that contains the ‘*name*‘ string, name would be ‘package-name’.

		$ sudo apt-get install '*name*'

11. How to install Packages without Upgrading
Using sub ‘–no-upgrade‘ command will prevent already installed packages from upgrading.

		$ sudo apt-get install packageName --no-upgrade

12. How to Upgrade Only Specific Packages
The ‘–only-upgrade‘ command do not install new packages but it only upgrade the already installed packages and disables new installation of packages.

13. How Do I Install Specific Package Version?
Let’s say you wish to install only specific version of packages, simply use the ‘=‘ with the package-name and append desired version.

		$ sudo apt-get install vsftpd=2.3.5-3ubuntu1

To un-install software packages without removing their configuration files (for later re-use the same configuration). Use the ‘remove‘ command as shown.

		$ sudo apt-get remove vsftpd
15. How Do I Completely Remove Packages
To remove software packages including their configuration files, use the ‘purge‘ sub command as shown below.

		$ sudo apt-get purge vsftpd

Alternatively, you can combine both the commands together as shown below.

		$ sudo apt-get remove --purge vsftpd

16. How I Can Clean Up Disk Space
The ‘clean‘ command is used to free up the disk space by cleaning retrieved (downloaded) .deb files (packages) from the local repository.

		$ sudo apt-get clean

17. How Do I Download Only Source Code of Package
To download only source code of particular package, use the option ‘–download-only source‘ with ‘package-name’ as shown.

		$ sudo apt-get --download-only source vsftpd

18. How Can I Download and Unpack a Package
To download and unpack source code of a package to a specific directory, type the following command.

		$ sudo apt-get source vsftpd


19.  `Download, Unpack and Compile a Package` You can also download, unpack and compile the source code at the same time, using option ‘–compile‘ as shown below.

            $ sudo apt-get --compile source goaccess

20. How Do I Download a Package Without Installing
Using ‘download‘ option, you can download any given package without installing it. For example, the following command will only download ‘nethogs‘ package to current working directory.

		$ sudo apt-get download nethogs

21. How Do I Check Change Log of Package?
The ‘changelog‘ flag downloads a package change-log and shows the package version that is installed.

		$ sudo apt-get changelog vsftpd

22. How Do I Check Broken Dependencies?
The ‘check‘ command is a diagnostic tool. It used to update package cache and checks for broken dependencies.

		$ sudo apt-get check

23. How Do I Search and Build Dependencies?
This ‘build-dep‘ command searches the local repositories in the system and install the build dependencies for package. If the package does not exists in the local repository it will return an error code.

		$ sudo apt-get build-dep netcat

24. How I Can Auto clean Apt-Get Cache?
The ‘autoclean‘ command deletes all .deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives to free-up significant volume of disk space.

		$ sudo apt-get autoclean

25. How I Can Auto remove Installed Packages?
The ‘autoremove‘ sub command is used to auto remove packages that were certainly installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and but they were now no longer required. For example, the following command will remove an installed package with its dependencies.

		$ sudo apt-get autoremove vsftpd

I’ve covered most of the available options with apt-get and apt-cache commands, but still there are more options available, you can check them out using ‘man apt-get‘ or ‘man apt-cache‘ from the terminal. I hope you enjoyed reading this article, If I’ve missed anything and you would like me to add to the list. Please feel free to mention in the comment below.

This following command will download all installed packages to directory /var/cache/apt/archives.

		$ sudo dpkg -l | grep "^ii"| awk ' {print $2} ' | xargs sudo apt-get -y install --reinstall --download-only

## fd command

Most of the Linux users are well familiar with the find command and the many cases it can be used. Today we are going to review an alternative to find command, called fd.

fd, is a simple, fast and user-friendly tool meant to simply perform faster compared to find. It is not meant to completely replace find, but rather give you an easy to use alternative that performs slightly faster.

Some of the notable features of fd:

Easy to use syntax – fd *pattern* instead of find -iname *pattern*.
Colorful output similar to the one of ls command.
Fast performance. Developer’s benchmarks are available here.
Smart search with case-insensitive by default and switches to case sensitive if patter containers an uppercase symbol.
Does not look in hidden files and directories by default.
Does not look into .gitignore by default.
Unicode awareness.

How to Install fd in Linux

For Ubuntu and Debian based distros, you will need to download the latest fd version from the release page and install it using following commands.

		$ wget https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/releases/download/v7.3.0/fd-musl_7.3.0_amd64.deb
		$ sudo dpkg -i fd-musl_7.3.0_amd64.deb

On Other Linux distributions, you can install fd from the default repository using package manager as shown.

		$# dnf install fd-find  [On Fedora]
		$# pacman -S fd         [On Arch Linux]
		$# emerge -av fd        [On Gentoo]
		$# zypper in fd         [On OpenSuse]

How to Use fd in Linux
Similar to find command, fd has many uses cases, but let’s start at checking the available options:

		$# fd -h
OR
		$# fd --help

You can run fd without any arguments, the output is very similar to ls -R command.

		$# fd
In the next fd examples, I will use a default WordPress installation located in /var/www/html/ to search for different files and folders.

In the example below, I have taken only the first 10 results for shorter output of the command.

		$# fd | head

Let’s say we want to find all jpg files. We can use the “-e” flag to filter by file extension:

		$# fd -e jpg

The “-e” flag can be used in combination with a pattern like this:

		$# fd -e php index
The above command will look for files with extension php and have the string “index” in them: "*index*.php"


If you want to exclude some results, you can use the “-E” flag like this:

		$# fd -e php index -E wp-content
This command will look for all files with php extension, containing the string “index” and will exclude results from the “wp-content” directory.

If you want to specify a search directory, you simply need to give it as argument:

		$# fd <pattern> <directory>

Just as find, you can use -x or --exec arguments to perform parallel command execution with the search results.

Here is an example where we will use chmod to change permissions of the image files

		$# fd -e jpg -x chmod 644 {}
The above will find all files with extension jpg and will run chmod 644 <path-to-file>.

Here is some useful explanation and usage of the brackets:

{} – A placeholder which will be changed with the path of the search result (wp-content/uploads/01.jpg).
{.} – similar to {}, but without using the file extension (wp-content/uploads/01).
{/}: A placeholder that will be replaced by the basename of the search result (01.jpg).
{//}: Parent directory of the discovered path (wp-content/uploads).
{/.}: Only the basename, without the extension (01).


## find

		$ mtr -i 2 google.com

8. You can use TCP SYN packets or UDP datagrams instead of the default ICMP ECHO requests as shown.

		$ mtr --tcp test.com
OR
		$ mtr --udp test.com

9. To specify the maximum number of hops (default is 30) to be probed between the local system and the remote machine, use the -m flag.

		$ mtr -m 35 216.58.223.78

10. While probing network quality, you can set the packet size used in bytes using the -s flag like so.

		$ mtr -r -s PACKETSIZE -c 5 google.com >mtr-report

With these examples, you should be good to go with using mtr, see man page for more usage options.

How to Install Bash-it in Linux
To install Bash-it, first you need to clone the following repository to a location of your choice, for example:

		$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it.git ~/.bash_it
Then run the following command to install Bash-it (it automatically backup your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc, depending on your OS). You will be asked “Would you like to keep your .bashrc and append bash-it templates at the end? [y/N]”, answer according to your preference.

		$ ~/.bash_it/install.sh

After installation, you can use ls command to verify the bash-it installation files and directories as shown.

		$ ls .bash_it/
Verify Bash-It Installation
Verify Bash-It Installation

To start using Bash-it, open a new tab or run:

		$ source $HOME/.bashrc
How to Customize Bash-it in Linux
To customize Bash-it, you need to edit your modified ~/.bashrc shell startup file. To list all installed and available aliases, completions, and plugins run the following commands, which should also shows you how to enable or disable them:


		$ bash-it show aliases
		$ bash-it show completions
		$ bash-it show plugins
Next, we will demonstrate how to enable aliases, but before that, first list the current aliases with the following command.

		$ alias
View Current Aliases in Linux
View Current Aliases in Linux

All the aliases are located in the $HOME/.bash_it/aliases/ directory. Now let’s enable the apt aliases as shown.

		$ bash-it enable alias apt
Enable Alias in Linux
Enable Alias in Linux

Then reload bash-it configs and check the current aliases once more.

		$ bash-it reload
		$ alias
From the output of the alias command, the apt aliases are now enabled.

Check Current Aliases in Linux
Check Current Aliases in Linux

You can disable newly enabled alias with the following commands.

		$ bash-it disable alias apt
		$ bash-it reload
Disable Aliases in Linux
Disable Aliases in Linux

In the next section, we will use similar steps to enable or disable completions ($HOME/.bash_it/completion/) and plugins ($HOME/..bash_it/plugins/). All enabled features are located in the $HOME/.bash_it/enabled directory.

How to Manage Bash-it Theme
The default theme for bash-it is bobby; you can check this using the BASH_IT_THEME env variable as shown.

echo $BASH_IT_THEME
Check Bash-it Theme
Check Bash-it Theme

You can find over 50+ Bash-it themes in the $BASH_IT/themes directory.

		$ ls $BASH_IT/themes
View Bash-It Themes
View Bash-It Themes

To preview all the themes in your shell before using any, run the following command.

		$ BASH_PREVIEW=true bash-it reload
Preview All Bash-It Themes
Preview All Bash-It Themes

Once you have identified a theme to use, open your .bashrc file and find the following line in it and change it value to the name of the theme you want, for example:

		$ export BASH_IT_THEME='essential'
Change Bash-It Theme
Change Bash-It Theme

Save the file and close, and source it as shown before.

		$ source $HOME/.bashrc
Note: In case you have built a your own custom themes outside of $BASH_IT/themes directory, point the BASH_IT_THEME variable directly to the theme file:

export BASH_IT_THEME='/path/to/your/custom/theme/'
And to disable theming, leave the above env variable empty.

export BASH_IT_THEME=''
How to Search Plugins, Aliases or Completions
You can easily check out which of the plugins, aliases or completions are available for a specific programming language, framework or an environment.

The trick is simple: just search for multiple terms related to some of the commands you use frequently, for example:



		$ bash-it search python pip pip3 pipenv
		$ bash-it search git
Search in Bash-It
Search in Bash-It

To view help messages for the aliases, completions and plugins, run:

		$ bash-it help aliases
		$ bash-it help completions
		$ bash-it help plugins


You can create you own custom scripts, and aliases, in the following files in the respective directories:

aliases/custom.aliases.bash
completion/custom.completion.bash
lib/custom.bash
plugins/custom.plugins.bash
custom/themes//<custom theme name>.theme.bash
Updating and Uninstalling Bash-It
To update Bash-it to the latest version, simply run:

		$ bash-it update
If you don’t like Bash-it anymore, you can uninstall it by running the following commands.

		$ cd $BASH_IT
		$ ./uninstall.sh
The uninstall.sh script will restore your previous Bash startup file. Once it has completed the operation, you need to remove the Bash-it directory from your machine by running.

		$ rm -rf $BASH_IT
And remember to start a new shell for the recent changes to work or source it again as shown.

		$ source $HOME/.bashrc
You can see all usage options by running:

		$ bash-it help
Finally, Bash-it comes with a number of cool features related to Git.

For more information, see the Bash-it Github repository: https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it.



Launch an Editor
Open a terminal and press Ctrl+X and Ctrl+E to open an editor (nano editor) with an empty buffer. Bash will try to launch the editor defined by the $EDITOR environment variable.

Nano Editor

Controlling The Screen
These shortcuts are used to control terminal screen output:

Ctrl+L – clears the screen (same effect as the “clear” command).
Ctrl+S – pause all command output to the screen. If you have executed a command that produces verbose, long output, use this to pause the output scrolling down the screen.
Ctrl+Q – resume output to the screen after pausing it with Ctrl+S.
Move Cursor on The Command Line


The next shortcuts are used for moving the cursor within the command-line:

Ctrl+A or Home – moves the cursor to the start of a line.
Ctrl+E or End – moves the cursor to the end of the line.
Ctrl+B or Left Arrow – moves the cursor back one character at a time.
Ctrl+F or Right Arrow – moves the cursor forward one character at a time.
Ctrl + Left Arrow or Alt+B or Esc and then B – moves the cursor back one word at a time.
Ctrl + Right Arrow or Alt+C or Esc and then F – moves the cursor forward one word at a time.
Search Through Bash History
The following shortcuts are used for searching for commands in the bash history:

Up arrow key – retrieves the previous command. If you press it constantly, it takes you through multiple commands in history, so you can find the one you want. Use the Down arrow to move in the reverse direction through the history.
Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N – alternatives for the Up and Down arrow keys, respectively.
Ctrl+R – starts a reverse search, through the bash history, simply type characters that should be unique to the command you want to find in the history.
Ctrl+S – launches a forward search, through the bash history.
Ctrl+G – quits reverse or forward search, through the bash history.
Delete Text on the Command Line
The following shortcuts are used for deleting text on the command line:

Ctrl+D or Delete – remove or deletes the character under the cursor.
Ctrl+K – removes all text from the cursor to the end of the line.
Ctrl+X and then Backspace – removes all the text from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
Transpose Text or Change Case on the Command Line
These shortcuts will transpose or change the case of letters or words on the command line:

Ctrl+T – transposes the character before the cursor with the character under the cursor.
Esc and then T – transposes the two words immediately before (or under) the cursor.
Esc and then U – transforms the text from the cursor to the end of the word to uppercase.
Esc and then L – transforms the text from the cursor to the end of the word to lowercase.
Esc and then C – changes the letter under the cursor (or the first letter of the next word) to uppercase, leaving the rest of the word unchanged.
Working With Processes in Linux
The following shortcuts help you to control running Linux processes.

Ctrl+Z – suspend the current foreground process. This sends the SIGTSTP signal to the process. You can get the process back to the foreground later using the fg process_name (or %bgprocess_number like %1, %2 and so on) command.
Ctrl+C – interrupt the current foreground process, by sending the SIGINT signal to it. The default behavior is to terminate a process gracefully, but the process can either honor or ignore it.
Ctrl+D – exit the bash shell (same as running the exit command).
Learn more about: All You Need To Know About Processes in Linux [Comprehensive Guide]

Bash Bang (!) Commands
In the final part of this article, we will explain some useful ! (bang) operations:

!! – execute last command.
!top – execute the most recent command that starts with ‘top’ (e.g. !).
!top:p – displays the command that !top would run (also adds it as the latest command in the command history).
!$ – execute the last word of the previous command (same as Alt +., e.g. if last command is ‘cat tecmint.txt’, then !$ would try to run ‘tecmint.txt’).
!$:p – displays the word that !$ would execute.
!* – displays the last word of the previous command.
!*:p – displays the last word that !* would substitute.
For more information, see the bash man page:

When you turn on your machine, immediately after POST (Power On Self Test) is completed successfully, the BIOS locates the configured bootable media, and reads some instructions from the master boot record (MBR) or GUID partition table which is the first 512 bytes of the bootable media. The MBR contains two important sets of information, one is the boot loader and two, the partition table.

What is a Boot Loader?
A boot loader is a small program stored in the MBR or GUID partition table that helps to load an operating system into memory. Without a boot loader, your operating system can not be loaded into memory.

Suggested Read: A Basic Guide to Linux Boot Process

There are several boot loaders we can install together with Linux on our systems and in this article, we shall briefly talk about a handful of the best Linux boot loaders to work with.

1. GNU GRUB
GNU GRUB is a popular and probably the most used multiboot Linux boot loader available, based on the original GRUB (GRand Unified Bootlader) which was created by Eirch Stefan Broleyn. It comes with several improvements, new features and bug fixes as enhancements of the original GRUB program.



Importantly, GRUB 2 has now replaced the GRUB. And notably, the name GRUB was renamed to GRUB Legacy and is not actively developed, however, it can be used for booting older systems since bug fixes are still on going.

GRUB has the following prominent features:

Supports multiboot
Supports multiple hardware architectures and operating systems such as Linux and Windows
Offers a Bash-like interactive command line interface for users to run GRUB commands as well interact with configuration files
Enables access to GRUB editor
Supports setting of passwords with encryption for security
Supports booting from a network combined with several other minor features

2. LILO (Linux Loader)
LILO is a simple yet powerful and stable Linux boot loader. With the growing popularity and use of GRUB, which has come with numerous improvements and powerful features, LILO has become less popular among Linux users.

While it loads, the word “LILO” is displayed on the screen and each letter appears before or after a particular event has occurred. However, the development of LILO was stopped in December 2015, it has a number of features as listed below:

Does not offer an interactive command line interface
Supports several error codes
Offers no support for booting from a network
All its files are stored in the first 1024 cylinders of a drive
Faces limitation with BTFS, GPT and RAID plus many more.

3. BURG – New Boot Loader
Based on GRUB, BURG is a relatively new Linux boot loader. Because it is derived from GRUB, it ships in with some of the primary GRUB features, nonetheless, it also offers remarkable features such as a new object format to support multiple platforms including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, FreeBSD and beyond.

Additionally, it supports a highly configurable text and graphical mode boot menu, stream plus planned future improvements for it to work with various input/output devices.

4. Syslinux
Syslinux is an assortment of light weight boot loaders that enable booting from CD-ROMs, from a network and so on. It supports filesystems such as FAT for MS-DOS, and ext2, ext3, ext4 for Linux. It as well supports uncompressed single-device Btrfs.

Note that Syslinux only accesses files in its own partition, therefore, it does not offer multi-filesystem boot capabilities.

Conclusion
A boot loader allows you to manage multiple operating systems on your machine and select which one to use at a particular time, without it, your machine can not load the kernel and the rest of the operating system files.
