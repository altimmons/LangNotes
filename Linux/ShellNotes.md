        - also is the EOF command 
- [[ctrl+w]] - Erases one word in the current line
- [[ctrl+u]] - Erases the whole line
- [[ctrl+r]] - Type to bring up a recent command
- [[!!]] - Repeats the last command

        `$` - complete Environment Name
        `!` - command name or file name **same as [[Tab]]**
- [[Ctrl]] + [[Alt]] + [[T]] or [[Super]] + [[T]] to open **Terminal**
- [[Ctrl]] + [[Shift]] + [[T]] - open a new terminal tab
- [[CTRL]] + [[r]] - Reverse Search
- [[CTRL]] + [[d]] - EOF - indicates EOF
- [[CTRL]] + [[z]] - put current thread in the *background* or _stop_
     - `fg` bring it back
     - or `jobs` then
     - `fg` *NAME*
     - `fg` *NUMBER*
- [[CTRL]] + [[a]] - Beginning of line
- [[CTRL]] +  [[e]] - End of Line
- [[CTRL]] + [[k]] - Cut whats in front of the cursor
- [[CTRL]] + [[w]] - Cuts the entire line
- [[CTRL]] + [[Y]] - Paste
- [[ALT]] + [[F1]]-[[F6]] - Virtual Terminals
- [[F7]] - usually **X-window** (try [[ALT]][[F7]] or [[CTRL]][[ALT]][[F7]])
- [[CTRL]] + [[ALT]] + ([[F1]]-[[F6]]) - to change from within x-window

### screen

- `screen` starts a cli window manager- useful when connected via SSH (a single terminal window)

- `screen`
[[CTRL]] + [[A]], [[C]] - new virtual term

[[CTRL]] + [[N]] - Next
[[CTRL]] + [[P]] - Previous
[[CTRL]] + [[A]] - Last


### terminals

Debian uses 6 virtual character terminals.  By default you use 1 (VT1). TO get there use [[Ctrl]] + [[Alt]] + [[F1]]

[[F1]] - [[F6]] are the 6 character terminals.  1 has the Xwindow host on it.

From a character terminal [[Alt]] + [[F#]] will switch, but from a GUI [[ALT]] + [[CTRL]] + [[F#]] is required.

Login is on [[Ctrl]]+[[Alt]]+[[F1]].  Gui is on [[Alt]][[F7]]

### chvt

can also use the command `chvt` as in `chvt 2`

## Shutting Down

[[CTRL]]+[[D]] exits the terminal (logs out).

normal multiuser mode from the commandline - `shutdown -h now`

single-user mode from the commandline  `poweroff -i -f`

[[CTRL]] + [[ALT]] + [[DEL]] can shut down **if** `/etc/inittab` contains "ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -h now"

## help

- `man` *TOPIC* - opens the man page viewer ([LESS](#less)) to view doc.


- `man -K KEYWORD` - searched the man database, line by line for keyword match.]

- `man -f COMMAND`

        man SECTION# COMMAND
        man 2 time

But to get section number - use `apropos`KEYWORD

- `info` *COMMAND* - only works for some - more detailed than :

- `whatis` *COMMAND* - which provides a one-line answer.

All this must be built with ROOT as `makewhatis` (SLOW)

Reserved Words

>        if	then	elif	else	fi	time
>        for	in	until	while	do	done
>        case	esac	coproc	select	function
>        {	}	[[	]]	!


## Looping Constructs

**until** `until test-commands; do consequent-commands; done`

**while**  `while test-commands; do consequent-commands; done`

**for**  `for name [ [in [words …] ] ; ] do commands; done`

**for** - `for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do commands ; done`

**if**

    if test-commands; then
      consequent-commands;
    [elif more-test-commands; then
      more-consequents;]
    [else alternate-consequents;]
    fi

case

    The syntax of the case command is:

    case word in
        [ [(] pattern [| pattern]…) command-list ;;]…
    esac

Each clause must be terminated with `;;`, `;&`, or `;;&`. 
It’s a common idiom to use `*` as the final pattern to define the default case, matches all

        echo -n "Enter the name of an animal: "
        read ANIMAL
        echo -n "The $ANIMAL has "
        case $ANIMAL in
        horse | dog | cat) echo -n "four";;
        man | kangaroo ) echo -n "two";;
        *) echo -n "an unknown number of";;
        esac
        echo " leg



> - `;;` no subsequent matches are attempted after the first pattern match.
> - `;&` in place of `;;` causes execution to continue with the command-list associated with the next clause, if any.
> - `;;&` in place of `;;` causes the shell to test the patterns in the next clause, if any, and execute any associated command-list on a successful match, continuing the case statement execution as if the pattern list had not matched.

> - **return status** is zero if no pattern is matched. Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the command-list executed.

> *_select_* - The select construct allows the easy generation of menus. It has almost the same syntax as the for command:

    select name [in words …]; do commands; done

                select fname in *;
                do
                        echo you picked $fname \($REPLY\)
                        break;
                done

`let "expression"` -exactly equivalent to above.

`[[…]]`    _*[[ expression ]]*_   Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression expression. Expressions are composed of the primaries described below in Bash Conditional Expressions. Word splitting and filename expansion are not performed on the words between the [[ and ]]; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal are performed. Conditional operators such as `-f` must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries. 


`[[ $line =~ [[:space:]]*(a)?b ]]` will match a line (stored in the shell variable line) if there is a sequence of characters anywhere in the value consisting of any number, including zero, of characters in the space character class, zero or one instances of `a`, then a #:

### Expressions


Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence:

`( expression )` Returns the value of expression. This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.

`! expression `   True if expression is false.

`expression1 && expression2` - True if both expression1 and expression2 are true.

`expression1 || expression2`  -      True if either expression1 or expression2 is true. 


The `&&` and `||` operators do not evaluate expression2 if the value of expression1 is sufficient to determine the return value of the entire conditional expression. 
hen commands are grouped, redirections may be applied to the entire command list. For example, the output of all the commands in the list may be redirected to a single stream.



- `()` -   ( list )  -  Placing a list of commands between parentheses causes a subshell environment to be created (see Command Execution Environment), and each of the commands in list to be executed in that subshell. Since the list is executed in a subshell, variable assignments do not remain in effect after the subshell completes.

- `{}` -  { list; }   Placing a list of commands between curly braces causes the list to be executed in the current shell context. No subshell is created. The semicolon (or newline) following list is required. 

In addition to the creation of a subshell, there is a subtle difference between these two constructs due to historical reasons. The braces are reserved words, so they must be separated from the list by blanks or other shell metacharacters. The parentheses are operators, and are recognized as separate tokens by the shell even if they are not separated from the list by whitespace.

The exit status of both of these constructs is the exit status of list.

>       fname () compound-command \[ redirections \]
> 
> or
>               
>       function fname \[()\] compound-command \[ redirections \]

> This defines a shell function named fname. The reserved word `function` is optional. If the `function` reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional. The body of the function is the compound command compound-command 

(see [Compound Commands](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Compound-Commands)).

## Quick Look

- `/` - root
- `~` - home
- `..` - one step up in tree
- `.` - cwd
- `<`, `>` - pipe stream
   - `2>` redirects StdErr (instead of StdOut)
        make someFile 2> /dev/null

   squelches error output
   - `&>` - Redirects both stderr and stdout to another destination.
        make &> /dev/null
- `>>` - append stream
- `<<` - starts std input to take in information.  Exit with [[CTRL]] + [[D]].
    - `<<WORD` - Starts StdInput until *WORD* is typed.  The result is sent without word. e.g.:
                $echo <<WORLD
                $HELLO WORLD
                >HELLO
- `|` pipe character
    - e.g. `set | less`
    - e.g. `cat file1.txt file2.txt | less`
- `|&` - pipe char- only this pipes stdout  AND stderr.
- `tee` - sends output to a file AND StdOut. Like a `Y` or `T` exchange.
        ls /home/user | tee my_directories.txt
- `&&` combines commands
        - on error does not continue
        - logical and, works on the basis of return code being 0.
- `||` - logical or
        - e.g. `ls || pwd`
        - if the first command is successful, the second command does not execute.  Only executes if prior command failed.
- `;` line break, combines commands,
        - e.g `ls ; cal ; date`
        - on error - continues
- `!` - bang character.
        - `!n` = execute the nth prior command
                e.g. `!2`
        - `!!` - last command
        - `!-n` - execute the command n times before
                - `!-1` == `!!`
        - `!STRING` - executes the last command starting with 'STRING'
                - e.g `!cd` runs the last command starting with 'cd'
        - `!?STRING?` - executes the last command containing
        - `COMMAND !*` - executes "COMMAND" with the last command's arguments
        - `!:^` -== `!:0` - first arg
        - `!:$` - last arg
        - `!:2-3` the second and third arg.
        - `!-2:3-$` combining the two.
Starting with ! accesses history
        COM1 -Opt1 -Opt2 -Opt3
        COM2 !* == COM2 -Opt1 -Opt2 -Opt3

   `*` - `$*` -  Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word.
   - `@` - (`$@`)Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. I

   - `#` - ($#) Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.

   - `?` -    ($?) Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.

   - `-` - ($-, a hyphen.) Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the set builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the -i option).

   - `$` - ($$) Expands to the process ID of the shell. In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the invoking shell, not the subshell.

   - `!` - ($!) Expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background, whether executed as an asynchronous command or using the bg builtin (see Job Control Builtins).
   - `0` - ($0) Expands to the name of the shell or shell script. This is set at shell initialization. If Bash is invoked with a file of commands (see Shell Scripts), $0 is set to the name of that file.

### `~` Tilde Expavnsion

Accesses the directory stack


If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N, optionally prefixed by a `+` or a `-`, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the dirs builtin invoked with the characters following tilde in the tilde-prefix as an argument (see The Directory Stack). If the tilde-prefix, sans the tilde, consists of a number without a leading `+` or `-`, `+` is assumed. 
~

    The value of $HOME 
~/foo

    The string that would be displayed by ‘dirs +N’
~+N

    The string that would be displayed by ‘dirs +N’
~-N

    The string that would be displayed by ‘dirs -N’ 



!!!!!Attention Attention: Important `&`
- `&` suffix so that it runs as a background process and then issuing `disown %1` in bash or whatever job number the program is. Then you can safely close the terminal. So, it could be something like: `sudo my-program &;disown %1;exit;`

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3371294/how-can-i-recall-the-argument-of-the-previous-bash-command)



The shell command [[!]] recalls an old command from the history buffer.
[[!1]] - this starts from the beginning of the history.  In this case- there are 1500 entries, and this is the very first.
[[!2]] etc
[[!-1]] - start from the most recent.

`cat .zsh_history | wc -l`
running [[!$]] gives the last arguement `-l`  juist like reg-ex
running [[!^]] gives the first arguments - here .zsh_history.  Note the command isnt included.

`!2^` gives another item- .zshrc.  Its adjacent alphabeticallty but thats it...
`!-1^` try to get the negatives of the value. Running `!5` without the hat, it does whats show above.   `zsh: no such word in event`
`!^3` just puts the number at the end of the `!^` value.

`$_` the last argument.  Similar to `!$`.  


[[Alt]]+[[.]] ALT and period, Allegedly does as well but not working on the current machine I am on. 
[[Esc]]+[[.]] Esc + period is also supposed to do the same.

For items other than the first or last `!^` vs `!$` & `$_` you can do `!:1` to get a specific one.  Starts numbering after the command.

`!:0` works as expected, annd gives the first word in the last command.

`!!:0` - this actually does the same thing.

Can even do ranges!
`!:0-3`

`!:^-$` the values `^` and `$` are just variables, and can be substituted.

More advanced stuff

`!pattern` - most recent command matching pattern

`!!:s/find/replace` - last command, substitute find with replace

you can also `^find^replace`.

`!*` - all arguments from the previous command (after the program/built-in/script). e.g.: ls *.tmp *.cache rm !* 

You can even combine the two methods- running the commands vertically, and the arguments horizontally.
`!-2:3` - the command run 2 cmds prev. and the 3 argument.

[[CTRL]]+[[R]] Does a reverse search.



Just as [[M]]0[[.]] **(meta-dot** or **esc-dot** or **alt-dot)** is the readline function yank-last-arg, M-C-y (meta-control-y or esc-ctrl-y or ctrl-alt-y) is the readline function yank-nth-arg. Without specifying n, it yanks the first argument of the previous command.

To specify an argument, press Escape and a number or hold Alt and press a number. You can do Alt--to begin specifying a negative number then release Alt and press the digit (this will count from the end of the list of arguments.


$ echo a b c d e f g
a b c d e f g

[[Alt]][[CTRL]][[Y]]

-gives 'a' to show but we arent done

[[Alt]]+[[3]] [[Alt]]+[[Ctrl]]+[[Y]]
[[Alt]]+( [[-]]+[[2]] )  [[Alt]]+[[Ctrl]]+[[Y]]

^My ->M3->^My-> M- +2 -> M^y

where M is ALT and ^ is CTRL.


(^    )([A-Za-z0-9, _ -,+\\#.-\\!]+)(:)
\t- [[`$2`]]  $3  


!^      first argument
!$      last argument
!*      all arguments
!:2     second argument

!:2-3   second to third arguments
!:2-$   second to last arguments
!:2*    second to last arguments
!:2-    second to next to last arguments

!:0     the command
!!      repeat the previous line

$ man  -P 'less -p ^HISTORY\ EXPANSION' bash

### Word Designators

Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.
A : separates the event specification from the word designator.
It may be omitted if the word designator begins with a ^, $, *, -,
or %.  Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the
first word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the
current line separated by single spaces.

   0 (zero)
          The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
   n      The nth word.
   ^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.
   $      The last argument.
   %      The word matched by the most recent `?string?` search.
   x-y    A range of words; `-y` abbreviates `0-y`.
   *      All of the words but the zeroth.
          This is a synonym for `1-$`.  
          It is not an error to use * if there is just one word in
          the event; the empty string is returned in that case.
   x*     Abbreviates x-$.
   x-     Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word.

   If a word designator is supplied without an event
   specification, the previous command is used as the event.

----

#### Word Designators

[Using History Interactively](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Using-History-Interactively)

Word designators are used to select desired words from the event. A `:` separates the event specification from the word designator. It may be omitted if the word designator begins with a `^`, `$`, `*`, `-`, or `%`. Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being denoted by `0` (zero). Words are inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.

For example,

- `!!` - designates the preceding command. When you type this, the preceding command is repeated in toto.

- `!!:$` - designates the last argument of the preceding command. This may be shortened to !$.

- `!fi:2` - designates the second argument of the most recent command starting with the letters fi. 


Here are the word designators:

- `0 (zero)` -  The 0th word. For many applications, this is the command word.

- `n` - The nth word.

- `^` - The first argument; that is, word 1.

- `$` - The last argument.

- `%` - The first word matched by the most recent `?string?` search, if the search string begins with a character that is part of a word.

- `x-y` - A range of words; `-y` abbreviates `0-y`.

- `*` - All of the words, except the 0th. This is a synonym for `1-$`. It is not an error to use `*` if there is just one word in the event; the empty string is returned in that case.

- `x*` - Abbreviates `x-$`

- `x-` - Abbreviates `x-$` like `x*`, but omits the last word. If `x` is missing, it defaults to 0.


If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the previous command is used as the event.


----

### 9.3.1 Event Designators

An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list. Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to the current position in the history list.

- `!` - Start a history substitution, except when followed by a space, tab, the end of the line, `=` or `(` 
                - (when the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin).

- `!n` - Refer to command line n.

- `!-n` - Refer to the command n lines back.

- `!!` - Refer to the previous command. This is a synonym for `!-1`.

- `!string` - Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list starting with string.

- `!?string[?]` - Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list containing string. The trailing `?` may be omitted if the string is followed immediately by a newline. If string is missing, the string from the most recent search is used; it is an error if there is no previous search string.

- `^string1^string2^` - Quick Substitution. Repeat the last command, replacing string1 with string2. Equivalent to !!:s^string1^string2^.

- `!#` - The entire command line typed so far.


Previous: Word Designators, Up: History Interaction   [Contents][Index]
9.3.3 Modifiers

After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:`. These modify, or edit, the word or words selected from the history event.

- `h` - Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.

- `t` - Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.

- `r` - Remove a trailing suffix of the form `.suffix`, leaving the basename.

- `e` - Remove all but the trailing suffix.

- `p` - Print the new command but do not execute it.

- `q` - Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.

- `x` - Quote the substituted words as with `q`, but break into words at spaces, tabs, and newlines. The `q` and `x` modifiers are mutually exclusive; the last one supplied is used.

- `s/old/new/` - Substitute new for the first occurrence of old in the event line. Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of `/`. The delimiter may be quoted in old and new with a single backslash. If `&` appears in new, it is replaced by old. A single backslash will quote the `&`. If old is null, it is set to the last old substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions took place, the last string in a !?string[?] search. If new is is null, each matching old is deleted. The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character on the input line.

- `&` - Repeat the previous substitution.


- `a` | `g`  - Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line. Used in conjunction with `s`, as in gs/old/new/, or with `&`.

- `G` - Apply the following `s` or `&` modifier once to each word in the event.
----

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04
To insert previous arguments:

    `Alt+.` [[Alt]]+[[.]]: insert last argument from last command.
    `Alt+#+.` [[Alt]]+[[#]]+[[.]]: insert #nth last argument from last command.
`Alt+-` , `#` , `Alt+.` **bash:** [[Alt]]+[[-]] , [[#]] , [[Alt]]+[[.]]
`Alt+-#+.` ** zsh:** [[Alt]]+[[-]]+[[#]]+[[.]]
         insert #nth first argument from last command. 

In Linux you can repeat commands to go back in history
Example:

Last command is:

mv foo bar

`Alt+0+.` [[Alt]]+[[0]]+[[.]]: insert first argument of last command = mv
`Alt+2+.` [[Alt]]+[[2]]+[[.]]: insert last 2nd argument of last command = foo
    up , [[Ctrl]]+[[w]]: last command without the last word = mv foo

General shortcuts


`Ctrl+w`
    [[Ctrl]]+[[w]]: removes last word from cursor
`Alt+d`
    [[Alt]]+[[d]]: removes next word from cursor
`Ctrl+k`
    [[Ctrl]]+[[k]]: cuts everything after cursor
`Ctrl+u`, zsh: `Alt+w`
    [[Ctrl]]+[[u]], zsh: [[Alt]]+[[w]]: cuts everything before cursor
    zsh: [[Ctrl]]+[[u]]: cuts the entire command (In bash you can combine [[Ctrl]]+[[u]] , [[Ctrl]]+[[k]])
`Ctrl+k`
`Ctrl+u`
`Ctrl+y`
    [[Ctrl]]+[[y]]: paste characters previously cut with [[Ctrl]]+[[u]] and [[Ctrl]]+[[k]]
`Ctrl+_`
    [[Ctrl]]+[[_]]: undo last edit (very useful when exceeding [[Ctrl]]+[[w]])
`Ctrl+left`
    [[Ctrl]]+[[left]]: move to last word
`Ctrl+right`
    [[Ctrl]]+[[right]]: move to next word
`home or Ctrl+a`
    home or [[Ctrl]]+[[a]]: move to start of line
`end or Ctrl+e`
    end or [[Ctrl]]+[[e]]: move to end of li





## Substitution

[Ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4009412/how-to-use-arguments-from-previous-command)



Also, there is hats substitution shortcut in the command line:

                echo Hello, world!
                ^Hello^Bye
                Bye, world!

to substitute the previous command's first matched string, meaning:

        Hello, world! Hello, people!
        ^Hello^Bye

would result in:

        Bye, world! Hello, people!      

The above is just a shortcut for:

        !:s/Hello/Bye

event-level(*) substitution for the first found (matched) string in the previous command, while prefixing the first part with the g switch will apply to the whole line globally:

        echo Hello, world! Hello, people!

        !:gs/Hello/Bye

        Bye, world! Bye, people!




### environmental and shell variables

running `export` displays them.

Here are some common environmental variables that you will come across:

- `SHELL`: This describes the shell--in most cases, this will be **bash** but other values can be set if you prefer other options.
- `TERM`: This specifies the type of terminal to emulate when running the shell. Different hardware terminals can be emulated based on requirements.
- `USER`: The current logged in **user.**
- `PWD`: The *current working directory.*
- `OLDPWD`: The *previous working directory.* This is kept by the shell in order to switch back by running `cd -`.
- `LS_COLORS`: This defines color codes that are used to optionally add colored output to the ls command.
- `MAIL`: The path to the current user's mailbox.
- **`PATH`**: A list of directories that the system will check when looking for commands. When a user types in a command, the system will check directories in this order for the executable.
- `LANG`: The current language and localization settings, including character encoding.
- `HOME`: The current user's home directory.
`_`: The most recent previously executed command.
In addition to these environmental variables, some shell variables that you'll often see are:

-`BASHOPTS`: The list of options that were used when bash was executed. This can be useful for finding out if the shell environment will operate in the way you want it to.
-`BASH_VERSION`: The version of bash being executed, in human-readable form.
-`BASH_VERSINFO`: The version of bash, in machine-readable output.
-`COLUMNS`: The number of columns wide that are being used to draw output on the screen.
-`DIRSTACK`: The stack of directories that are available with the pushd and popd commands.
-`HISTFILESIZE`: Number of lines of command history stored to a file.
-`HISTSIZE`: Number of lines of command history allowed in memory.
-`HOSTNAME`: The hostname of the computer at this time.
-`IFS`: The internal field separator to separate input on the command line. By default, this is a space.
-`PS1`: The primary command prompt definition. This is used to define what your prompt looks like when you -start a shell session. The PS2 is used to declare secondary prompts for when a command spans multiple lines.
-`SHELLOPTS`: Shell options that can be set with the set option.
-`UID`: The UID of the current user.

### Shell parameter Substitution

[Shell Parameter Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion)

!!!Tip Tip: A lot more here. Check out the link above.


!!!Note Todo clean this up.
   
${parameter:-word}

    If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substituted. Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.

${parameter:=word}

    If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is assigned to parameter. The value of parameter is then substituted. Positional parameters and special parameters may not be assigned to in this way.

${parameter:?word}

    If parameter is null or unset, the expansion of word (or a message to that effect if word is not present) is written to the standard error and the shell, if it is not interactive, exits. Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.

${parameter:+word}

    If parameter is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of word is substituted.

${parameter:offset}
${parameter:offset:length}

    This is referred to as Substring Expansion. It expands to up to length characters of the value of parameter starting at the character specified by offset. If parameter is `@`, an indexed array subscripted by `@` or `*`, or an associative array name, the results differ as described below. 
    
    See here.
[Shell Arithmetic](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Arithmetic)

${!prefix*}
${!prefix@}

    Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix, separated by the first character of the IFS special variable. When `@` is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.

${!name[@]}
${!name[*]}

    If name is an array variable, expands to the list of array indices (keys) assigned in name. If name is not an array, expands to 0 if name is set and null otherwise. When `@` is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each key expands to a separate word.

${#parameter}

    The length in characters of the expanded value of parameter is substituted. If parameter is `*` or `@`, the value substituted is the number of positional parameters. If parameter is an array name subscripted by `*` or `@`, the value substituted is the number of elements in the array. If parameter is an indexed array name subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of parameter, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

${parameter#word}
${parameter##word}

    The word is expanded to produce a pattern and matched according to the rules described below (see Pattern Matching). If the pattern matches the beginning of the expanded value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern (the `#` case) or the longest matching pattern (the `##` case) deleted. If parameter is `@` or `*`, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If parameter is an array variable subscripted with `@` or `*`, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

${parameter%word}
${parameter%%word}

    The word is expanded to produce a pattern and matched according to the rules described below (see Pattern Matching). If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the expanded value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern (the `%` case) or the longest matching pattern (the `%%` case) deleted. If parameter is `@` or `*`, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If parameter is an array variable subscripted with `@` or `*`, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

${parameter/pattern/string}

    The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in filename expansion. Parameter is expanded and the longest match of pattern against its value is replaced with string. The match is performed according to the rules described below (see Pattern Matching). If pattern begins with `/`, all matches of pattern are replaced with string. Normally only the first match is replaced. If pattern begins with `#`, it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of parameter. If pattern begins with `%`, it must match at the end of the expanded value of parameter. If string is null, matches of pattern are deleted and the / following pattern may be omitted. If the nocasematch shell option (see the description of shopt in The Shopt Builtin) is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. If parameter is `@` or `*`, the substitution operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If parameter is an array variable subscripted with `@` or `*`, the substitution operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

${parameter^pattern}
${parameter^^pattern}
${parameter,pattern}
${parameter,,pattern}

    This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic characters in parameter. The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in filename expansion. Each character in the expanded value of parameter is tested against pattern, and, if it matches the pattern, its case is converted. The pattern should not attempt to match more than one character. The `^` operator converts lowercase letters matching pattern to uppercase; the `,` operator converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase. The `^^` and `,,` expansions convert each matched character in the expanded value; the `^` and `,` expansions match and convert only the first character in the expanded value. If pattern is omitted, it is treated like a `?`, which matches every character. If parameter is `@` or `*`, the case modification operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If parameter is an array variable subscripted with `@` or `*`, the case modification operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

${parameter@operator}

    The expansion is either a transformation of the value of parameter or information about parameter itself, depending on the value of operator. Each operator is a single letter:

- `U` - The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with lowercase alphabetic characters converted to uppercase. 

- `u` - The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with the first character converted to uppercase, if it is alphabetic. 

- `L` - The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with uppercase alphabetic characters converted to lowercase. 

- `Q` - The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter quoted in a format that can be reused as input. 

- `E` - The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with backslash escape sequences expanded as with the $'…' quoting mechanism. 

- `P` - The expansion is a string that is the result of expanding the value of parameter as if it were a prompt string (see Controlling the Prompt). 

- `A` - The expansion is a string in the form of an assignment statement or declare command that, if evaluated, will recreate parameter with its attributes and value. 

- `K` - Produces a possibly-quoted version of the value of parameter, except that it prints the values of indexed and associative arrays as a sequence of quoted key-value pairs (see Arrays). 

- `a` - The expansion is a string consisting of flag values representing parameter’s attributes.

### Command Subsitution


Two methods:

!!!note: [[`]] (Backtick)
                command_1 `command_2 −options`
        This will execute "command_2" and it's output will become the input to "command_1".

!!!note: [[$]] (Dollar Sign)
                command_1 $(command_2 -options)
        Same as above

The _pipe_ command `|`- will do the same thing:

                cat file1.txt file2.txt | less

Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed as follows:

      $(command)
   or
      `command`

Bash performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. 

____
### Arithmetic Expansion

Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion is:

         $(( expression ))


___
### Process Substitution

Process substitution allows a process’s input or output to be referred to using a filename. It takes the form of

      <(list)
or
      >(list)

The process list is run asynchronously, and its input or output appears as a filename. This filename is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion
 
____
### Syntax

#### `{}` vs `()`

`{varname}` seems used to dereference a variable

`signal=$(nmcli device wifi | grep \* | awk '{print $6}')`

note the `$()` around the expression

There is no dollar sign required in front of ${print $6}

in this case `$6` is the variable that stores the 6th result of awk.

`echo $signal` and ``echo ${signal}` produce the same output

## Paths

An "_absolute path_" is easily recognised from the leading forward slash- `/boot/grub`

A _"relative path"_ doesn't have a preceding slash


## Filesystem


- `/` - **Root**
   - `bin` - **Binary** - biinaries are stored here, like *ls* and other things a regular single user might use.
   - `sbin` - System Binaries -- binary tools a system administrator might use.
   - `boot` - boot related files
   - `dev` - devices- devoces are mounted here. along with their drivers.
      - `sda`
      - `sdb` ... etc- hard disk mounting.
   - `etc` - Et cetera - "edit to configure" mneumonic- system wide settings- not per user settings
   - `home`
   - `lib`
      -`lib32`, `lib64` - libraries required for bin
   - `media` - Media directory, used to be called `mnt`  or in general most OS'es manage media for you by mounting devices (typically removable devices) while the user can use mount.  Things like USB sticks, external drives are found in `media` or `mnt`;
   - `opt` - contains manually installed software from vendors resides.  Usually user installed software doesnt go here.  But User created software can go here.
   - `proc` - process - Psudofiles that contain info on system processes or resources. Each Process has its own "pseudofile".  These are not actual files.  CPU information is in here.
   - `root` - Root User Home Folder- not a typical user directory.  Files stored here require root access.  This was to make sure that if user directories were on another directory, it wouldnt be lost.
   - `run` - variable- TempFS file system- like a temp directory.  It is stored in Ram and lost when the computer reboots.
   - `snap` -Snap Package directory- where Ubuntu stores the Snap packages.
   - `srv` - Service Directory- usually empty, but if computer is a webserver- then website or FTP files are stored here.
   - `sys` - System Files- contains Kernal pseudofiles.  It is not permanent.  Allows very low level access to kernal- for things like updating Video Card Settings.
   - `tmp` - Temporary- this is for applications to use during a session- things like temproray copies of a Document in progress.  A crashed program may lose access to the folder and it can begin to fill.  Might need to be cleared by Root user in Single User Mode.
   - `usr` - User or Unix System Resources - holds applications installed by the user.  These must be considered  non-essential.
      - `bin` - binaries
      - `sbin`- administration binaries

used on others.
- `Unshareable` files are those that are not shareable. For example, the files in user home directories are shareable whereas device lock files are not.
- `Static` files include binaries, libraries, documentation files and other files that do not change without system administrator intervention.
- `Variable` files are defined as files that are not static.


### `/` - Root

You cannot add to the root a sub-directory.

---


## pwd

- `pwd` print working dir


## tree

- `tree` prints an ASCII file tree

                tree −option(s) /optional/directory/to/list

- `-a` - **a**ll
- `-d` - **d**irectories only
- `-L #` - max **L**evels
- `P` - **P**attern - lists all files that match a Pattern
- `I` - lists all files that *do not* match a Pattern
- `-p` - print **p**ermissions for each file (a la ls -a)
- `-s` - print the **s**ize of each file (in bytes)
- `-h` - print the size of each file (in **h**uman readable format)

## find

- `find` seaches for files, using wildcards or regex.

                find / −name file

This would look for a file named "file" and start at the root directory (it will search all directories
including those that are mounted filesystems).

- `−name` -seach name-  case sensitive
- `−iname`- find name regardless of case.
- `−regex`- to find according to a regexp (case
sensitive)
- `−iregex` to find according to a regexp (case insensitive).
- `−exec`- executes a command on the files it
finds (such as moving or removing it or anything else...).

!!!example: For example if you wanted to remove everything it finds then you would use
                find -name *.doc  −exec rm −f

!!! example: To use the −exec option:
      - use `find` to find something,
      - then add the `−exec` option to the end, then:
      - `command_to_be_executed`
         - This is the tool you want to execute on the files find locates.
      - then `'{}'` or `\{\}` (curly brackets) for a placeholder variable.
         - The *curly brackets* "{}" are used to represent the current file found, then continue to sub `{}` for each additional file.     The brackets need protection by backslashes (`\`) or single−quotation marks (`'`), to stop bash expanding
      - then the *arguments*
      - then `';'` or `\;`
         - This is the symbol used by find to signal the end of the commands. It's usually protected by a backslash (\) or quotes to stop bash from trying to expand it.

                  find / −name '*.doc' −exec cp '{}' /tmp/ ';'

      The above command would find any files with the extension '`.doc`' and copy them to your `/tmp` directory.
- `−path`- exclude the particular folder
!!!note: you cannot have a '/' (forward slash) on the end)
- `−prune` - exclude the subdirectories.

!!!example example:
         find / −path '/mnt/win_c' −prune −o −name "string" −print
      This example will search your entire directory tree (everything that is mounted under it) excluding `/mnt/win_c` and all of the subdirectories under `/mnt/win_c`. When using the `−path` option you can use wildcards.

## slocate

- `slocate` outputs a list of all files on the system that match the **pattern,** giving their _full path name_ (it
doesn't have to be an exact match, anything which contains the word is shown).

!!!: Replaces locate
      **Secure locate** (`slocate`) is a replacement for `locate`, both have identical syntax. On most
      distributions `locate` is an `alias` to `slocate`.

Syntax:

      slocate STRING


!!!warning This won't work unless you run either `updatedb` *(as _root_)* or `slocate −u` *(as _root_)* for `slocate` to work.

## whereis

- `whereis` locates the **binary,** **source,** and **manual** page for a particular program, it uses _exact matches_ only,
- if you only know part of the name use `slocate`.

Command syntax:
      whereis program_name


## which

Virtually the same as `whereis`, except it *only finds the executable* (the physical program).
- It **only** looks in the `PATH` (environment variable) of a users shell.
- Use the `−a` option to list all occurances of the particular program_name in your path (so if there is more than one you can see it).

Command syntax:
      which program_name

----

## clear

- `clear` - scrolls N lines

## cd

unlike Windows, requires a space after command - `cd ..`

- `cd..` produces an error.-> `alias cd..="cd ..`

- `cd!` - goes back to the previous directory- like an *undo* for `cd`. (WRONG?)

- `cd -` - goes to PWD.  (Go back)
## ls

lists the files in a location

- `-l` - long
- `-a` - show hidden
- `-d`- directories
- `-F`- append symbols, such as **"*"** to executables
- `-S` - sort by file/dir size
- `-R` - show Dir structure
- "*.html" - show only html files
- `--color=auto` - shows ls in color.

        alias ls=ls --color=auto -la

can be added to bash.rc

                ls -d */
                alias lsd='ls -d */'

Shows directories that are sub directories of current.  If not already present, the second command can be added tp add the `lsd`

- `l`, `la`, and `ll` also work on some systems for `ls`, `-a` and `l`


## cat

- `cat` - concatenate- displays, compines, and creates text files.

- `cat` (no flags)- allows input - echo whatever is typed. `Cat` will open a simple editor.

[[Ctrl]] + [[D]] - exits `cat`

        cat list1.txt list2.txt

Concatenates the two files to StdOut.

- `-b` adds the line # to non-blank lines
- `-n` adds the line # to all lines
- `-s` removes multiple consecutive blank lines
- `-E` adds $ to each line break

        cat > text.txt

Opens a simple editor, and saves whatever is typed to *text.txt*, [[Ctrl]] + [[d]] exits.

Using `>>` appends.

        cat >> text.txt

        cat list1.txt list2.txt >> out.txt

combines list1 and list2, and then appends the result to out.txt.

        cat list1.txt list2.txt > list2.txt

Produces an error.  The correct way is:

        $cat list1.txt >> list2.txt

## mkdir

- `mkdir` creates a directory.

        mkdir image
        mkdir image/plus
                will produce an error
        mkdir -p image/plus
        mkdir -p image/{john,tom,bob}

- `-p`, `--parents` -  produces the entire path

## rmdir

- `rmdir` - Remove an _empty_ directory **only**. If you want to remove a directory with files in it type "`rm −R directory`" (see [`rm` below](#rm))

*`rmdir` a/b/c/d/e* - only removes `e`
*`rmdir` -p a/b/c/d/e* - removes the entire tree.

- `-p`, `--parents` -  produces the entire path
- `-v`, `--verbose` - produces the verbose output
- `-i`, `--interactive` - interactive

## rm

- `rm` - removes files and directories.

Command syntax:

      rm −options file_or_folder

only need to give a parent dir.

- `-p`, `--parents` -  produces the entire path
- `-v`, `--verbose` - produces the **v**erbose output
- `-i`, `--interactive` - **i**nteractive
- `-r`, `-R` - Remove **r**ecursively - to remove everything in sub-directories
- `-f` - **f**orce

!!!tip Disabling Aliases (per execution)
      On some systems such as Mandrake an `alias` will send `rm` to `rm −i` (prompting you for every file you wish to delete). To override this use: `\rm −R directory`
      - using the `\` disables the alias for this run only

## cp

`cp` -opts source dest

Command syntax:

      cp −options file_or_files new_location

- `-i`, `--interactive` - interactive
- `-v`, `--verbose` - produces the verbose output
- `-R` - recursive copying
- `-u` - only copy if source is newer than the destination or dest doesn't exist.
- `-n` - no clobber (over-ridden by i)

if destination doesnt exist, its created.

        cp ../file1.txt ../file2.txt .

   Copies file1 and file2 in parent dir to current dir

        cp file1.txt file2.txt dir1

   Copies file1 and 2 to dir1

      cp file1 file2

Simply copy file1 to file2 (in the same directory).

      cp /tmp/file1 ~/file2 /mnt/win_c

Where the last option is the directory to be copied to. The above example copies two files from different areas of the file system to `/mnt/win_c`

      cp −R directory_and_or_files new_location

This command will copy directories (and all subdirectories) and/or files to *new_location*

!!!: Can be used with wild cards (`*`) to copy multiple files

Note: `cp -nr ./../operator-mono-lig-master/ligature/ ./ligature/` does not do the same as `cp -nr ./../operator-mono-lig-master/ligature/* ./ligature/*` since the first tries to copy the directory, finds it and stops (and does not recurse into the contents)


## mv

`mv` - moves and *renames*

mv -opts src dest

mv file1.txt dir1/

- `-v`, `--verbose` - produces the verbose output
- `-i`, `--interactive` - interactive

!!!sample: Rename example:
         mv filename1 filename2
      Renames *filename1* to *filename2.*

!!!source: For example typing:
         mv /etc/configuration.txt /home/joe/backupconfig
   This would move the file *"configuration.txt"* to `/home/joe/` and rename it *"backupconfig"*

### rename

[See the related Bash Scripts](#Remamimg_Examples)

`rename` is a **perl** script which can be used to mass rename files according to a regular expression.

An example for renaming all ".JPG" files to ".jpg" is:

      rename 's/\.JPG$/.jpg/' *.JPG

#### Finding rename

You can get rename from various places.  **CPAN Search Site,** _Rename Script Version 1.4_


### mmv

`mmv` is a mass move/copy/renaming tool that uses standard wildcards to perform its functions.


However mmv supports some standard wildcards.
According to the manual the ";" wildcard is useful for matching files at any depth in the directory tree
(ie it will go below the current directory, recursively).

!!!example `mmv \*.JPG \#1.jpg`
The first pattern matches anything with a "`.JPG`" and renames each file (the "`#1`" matches the first wildcard) to "`.jpg`".
Each time you use a `\(wildcard)` you can use a `#x` to get that wildcard. Where `x` is a positive number
starting at 1.

- mad (mass append contents of source file to target name),
- mln (mass link to a source file).

!!!hint A Java alternative to **_mmv_** which runs on both GNU/Linux and Windows is available, [_**Esomaniac**_](http://www.esomaniac.de/)

## ln

`ln` - Create a link to a file. There are two types of links:

_Hard links_

**Hard links** are considered pointers to a file (the number is listed by typing `ls −l`). Each
**hard−link** is a reference to a file.
*The file itself only goes away when all hard−links are deleted.* If you delete the original file and there are hard links to it the original file will remain.

**hard−links** can only exist on the same file−system.

!!!Example
         ln target_name link_name
   Will create a **"hard link"** to `target_name` called `link_name`, you need to delete both of these to remove the file.

_Symbolic links_

**Symbolic links** are created by typing "`ln −s`".

When you remove the original file the symbolic
link becomes broken,
- a symbolic link is similar to a windows "short−cut".
- The advantage of symbolic links is that the target can be to something on another file−system,
- while hard−links can only exist on the same file−system.

!!!example
         ln −s target_name link_name
   This creates a symbolic link to "`target_name`" called "`link_name`", if you delete the original
   file the symbolic link won't work (it becomes a broken link).

## shred

`shred` -- Securely remove a file by overwriting it first.

!!!example
         shred −n 2 −z −v /dev/hda1
      - `-n 2` -- overwrite 2 times with random data
      - `-z` -- (then) - overwrite zeros
      - `-v` -- **v**erbose - show progress
   to partition /dev/hda1

!!!warning Shredding files doesn't work with all filesystems
      Please note (please see the manual and
      info pages for more information) shred does not work correctly on log−structured or journaled filesystems, such as **JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3** and *many other modern filesystems*

      !!!info Alternatives to using shred
         shred has its disadvantages when run on a filesystem. First of all since it has to be installed you cannot run shred on your operating systems filesystem, you also cannot use shred on a windows machine easily since you cannot install shred on this machine.

         You may like to try alternatives such as the _DBAN project_ that create self−booting ~~floppy disks~~ that can completely erase a machines hard disk.

      !!!info k


## less

- `less` - a simple text viewer.

   see [`nano`](#nano)

- [[Up]] and [[Down]] to move lines up and down.
- [[Space]] -> page down
- [[p]] + [[Shift]]  ([[P]]) - PageUp
- [[g]] + [[Shift]] ([[G]]) - End
- [[g]] -> Top
- [[/]] - forward slash searches forward

        $/book

   Searches forward  for 'book'

- [[n]] - next
- [[?]] - search backwards
- [[q]] - quit

## touch

`touch` - used to change the time stamp or create a new empty file

        $touch file6.txt

Creates `file6.txt`

!!!example `touch` Examples
         touch −t 05070915 my_report.txt[3]
      This command would change the timestamp on my_report.txt so that it would look like you created it at 9:15.
      - The first four digits stand for May 7th (0507), in MM−DD (American style)
      - the last four (0915) the time, 9:15 in the morning.

      Instead of using plain numbers to change the time, you can use options similar to that of the `date` tool.

         touch −d '5 May 2000' some_file.txt
      You can also use `−−date=` instead of `−d`.

      Also have a look at the [date command](#date) for examples on using `−d` and `−−date=` (the syntax for the date part is exactly the same when using `−d` or `−−date`).

Looking at Privledges

        $ touch test.sh
        $ ls -l *.sh
        >> -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 0 Tod 00 00:00 test.sh

    `touch` creates priviledges that are rw for user and group, and r for others, but not at all execute, in the case of an *.sh (shell script file)

## split

Command syntax:
      split −options file

`split` -Splits files into several smaller files.

- `−b ##`- split into *##* bytes,
- `−k ##` for ## kilobytes,
- `−m ##` - for ## megabytes.

You can use it to split text files and any other files... you can use cat to re−combine the files.
This may be useful if you have to transfer something to floppy disks or you wish to divide text files
into certain sizes.

      split −options file

This will split the input file into *1000 lines of input each (the default...),* and output (, with the input name _file,_ into "`fileaa,fileab,fileac`...etc." until the there is no more of the file left to split.

## nano

`nano` - file editor

- [[Ctrl]] + [[o]] - save (out)
- [[Ctrl]] + [[x]] - exit
- [[Ctrl]] + [[k]] - cut
- [[Ctrl]] + [[u]] - uncut (paste)

## sudo

Do a command as administrator

sudo -i - login as root
sudo -s - login as root as well.  [$] changes to [#] to indicate superuser mode.

## set

`set -x` - print each command (de-alias) before running
`set +x` - to turn off.

`set bell-style none`

`xset -b` (xwindows)

## history

        history n - lists the last n commands
        history

## script

`script` - write a log of bash to file.

## top

Check which programs are using memory or cpu

        $top

Gives a table of all the processes and processes (PID).

[[s]] to change the update time in seconds.Default update **s**peed is 3 seconds.

[[i]] - toggle filter idle processes

[[k]] - **kill** the command - by entering process id.

[[q]] - **quit** the top program

## echo

`echo` repeats whatever follows.

`echo *text*` == `echo "*text*"` - the double quotes are not necessary but are good form.

`-e` - allows the use of escaped text using backslash.

    \t - tab
    \n - new line
    \c - Dont do new line

!!!example: Will expand a command but not execute it- can be used to see what will be executed.
                echo rm -R *

### Using variables

        $myvar="Andy"
        $echo $myvar

note no spaces in the declaration statement.

        x=10
        echo "the value of x is $x"

### escaping text

Use the `-e` flag

        $echo -e 'some \text'
        some    ext

`-e` - allows the use of escaped text using backslash.

    \t - tab
    \n - new line
    \c - Dont do new line

?Unsure of the significance of single quotes in the example above

### Controlling the Prompt

Bash examines the value of the array variable PROMPT_COMMAND just before printing each primary prompt. If any elements in PROMPT_COMMAND are set and non-null, Bash executes each value, in numeric order, just as if it had been typed on the command line.

In addition, the following table describes the special characters which can appear in the prompt variables PS0, PS1, PS2, and PS4: 

- `\a` - A bell character. 

- `\d` - The date, in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26"). 

- `\D{format}` - The format is passed to `strftime(3)` and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty format results in a locale-specific time representation. The braces are required. 

- `\e` - An escape character. 

- `\h` - The hostname, up to the first ‘.’. 

- `\H` - The hostname. 

- `\j` - The number of jobs currently managed by the shell. 

- `\l` - The basename of the shell’s terminal device name. 

- `\n` - A newline. 

- `\r` - A carriage return. 

- `\s` - The name of the shell, the basename of `$0` (the portion following the final slash). 

- `\t` - The time, in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format. 

- `\T` - The time, in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format. 

- `\@` - The time, in 12-hour am/pm format. 

- `\A` - The time, in 24-hour HH:MM format. 

- `\u` - The username of the current user. 

- `\v` - The version of Bash (e.g., 2.00) 

- `\V` - The release of Bash, version + patchlevel (e.g., 2.00.0) 

- `\w` - The current working directory, with `$HOME` abbreviated with a tilde (uses the `$PROMPT_DIRTRIM` variable). 

- `\W` - The basename of $PWD, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde. 

- `\!` - The history number of this command. 

- `\#` - The command number of this command. 

- `\$` - If the effective uid is 0, #, otherwise $. 

- `\nnn` - The character whose ASCII code is the octal value nnn. 

- `\\` - A backslash. 

- `\[` - Begin a sequence of non-printing characters. This could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt. 

- `\]` - End a sequence of non-printing characters. 



### Keep the cursor on the same line

Use `\C`, requires `-e` to allow escaped chars

echo -e "Enter the File Name : \c"

## File permissions

Basically its {`d`/`-`}(`u`ser)`rwx`(`g`roup)`rwx`( `o`thers)`rwx` w/ `-` turning it off.
Access Levels
- None (-)
- read (r)
- write (w)
- execute (x)

You can see these by using the ls -l Unix command.

0123456789

`drwxr-xr-x`

`-rwxr-xr-x`

`-rwxrwxrwx`

The first character represents the entry type.  The entry type for a directory is 'd'.

All files have a hyphen (-) as their entry type.  The remaining nine characters indicate the permissions themselves in 3 groups of three.

1 through 3 show user (u) permissions;
4 through 6 are group (g) permissions;
7 through 9 are other (o) permissions (users who are not the owner and are not members of the group own the file/directory, a.k.a. "the world").

can also take away the read and write permissions by doing the following:

chmod o-rw /home/yourusername

### CHMOD

`chmod o+x filename` - chmod changes the permissions, `o` is for other's group (the third), `+` adds the permission, and `x` adds the execute permission

to give the world permission to read and write to your home directory, then you would use the command `chmod o+rw /home/youruserna`

other examples

- `chmod g+x filename` (add group execute perm.)
- `chmod g-wx filename` (remove group write and exec.)
- `chmod ug=rwx filename` (change user and group to read, write and execute)
- `chmod ugo-rwx` or `chmod a-rwx` remove read write exec from all three groups.
- `chmod u+rw,g=rw,o+r filename` commma to chain multiple commands.
- `chmod +x filename` gives the execute permission to everyone

```sh
ls -l

-rwxrwxrwx 1
```

- first char is the type `-` = normal file, `d` = directory, `b` = binary, `c` = character special file.
- first group of 3 is user
- second group of three is the group
- third is the others permissions.
- this is followed by a number- the number of symbolic links to a file.

### directory permissions

        mkdir dir
        ls -ld dir
        touch dir/{file1,file2,file3}
        ls dir/
            file1 file2 file3
        chmod u-w dir
        cd dir/
        touch file4
            **error
        chmod u+w dir
        chmod u-r dir

with out read permissions - then the user cannot even see the file.

`ls` produces an error.

    chmod u=rw,u-x dir

`ls -l dir` will show the names of the file but no other info. `ls dir/` produces errors but shows the folders.  THe first command just produces '?' in the responses.

### Octal file permissions.

numerical representation of permissions

| users | group | others |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| r w x | r w x | r w x  |
| + + + | + - + | + + -  |
| 1 1 1 | 1 0 1 | 1 1 0  |
| 4 2 1 | 4 0 1 | 4 2 0  |
| 7     | 5     | 6      |

0 - [---] - 000
1 - [--x] - 001
2 - [-w-] - 010
3 - [-wx] - 011
4 - [r--] - 100
5 - [r-x] - 101
6 - [rw-] - 110
7 - [rwx] - 111

- `chmod 000 filename` this gives no permission to anyone
- `chmod 755 filename` user has r/w/x but group and others have only rx.

0-7- in 3 separate digits, one for each of the 3 groups.

chmod ABC -filename

## kill

*kill* command kills processes.

        kill -KILL *pid*

forces the process to exit- powerful

        kill -9 *pid*

this executes a sigkill

        ps -ux

Lists all the running processes.

## ps

list the processes

- `ps -ux` show the user's processes

- `ps -aux` show ALL user's processes

- `ps -U *username*` - show a specific users processes

- `ps -C *process name*` - lists all the instances of a process given a name

## which

used to return the path name of a command,

        which ls

gives the location of the ls program.

In Bash scripting you may need to use the full location of a comman- eg /bin/ls

        which alias
        which firefox

## whatis

Gets the 'one line' descrption from the man pages.

        whatis firefox
        whatis cat

## whereis

        whereis - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command

                OPTIONS
                -b     Search for binaries.

                -m     Search for manuals.

                -s     Search for sources.

                -u     Only show the command names that have unusual entries.  A command is said to be unusual if it does not have just one entry of each explicitly requested type.  Thus 'whereis -m -u *' asks for those files in the  current
                        directory which have no documentation file, or more than one.

                -B [list] - Limit the places where whereis searches for binaries, by a whitespace-separated list of directories.

                -M [list] - Limit the places where whereis searches for manuals and documentation in Info format, by a whitespace-separated list of directories.

                -S [list] - Limit the places where whereis searches for sources, by a whitespace-separated list of directories.

examples:

`whereis -bm ls tr -m gcc` - searches for "ls" and "tr" binaries and man pages, and for "gcc" man pages only.   The search restrictions (options -b, -m and -s) are cumulative and apply to the subsequent name patterns on the command line.

`whereis -m ls -M /usr/share/man/man1 -f cal` - searches for "ls" man pages in all default paths, but for "cal" in the `/usr/share/man/man1` directory only. The options -B, -M and -S reset search paths for the subsequent name patterns.

## Bash Scripting

`nano myscript.sh` opens a new file named myscript in the nano editor.

First line is usually a **hashbang**

        $which bash
        /bin/bash

The first line gives the location of the bash.

        1- #! /bin/bash
        2- ls -l

        $./myscript.sh
            **permission denied
        $chmod +x

Trying to run initially is not allowed, but adding the execute permissions allows it to run

        #! /bin/bash

        STRING="Hello World"
        echo $STRING

### Remamimg Examples

Bash scripting is one way to rename files. You can develop a set of instructions (a script) to rename
files. Scripts are useful if you don't have mmv or rename...
One way to this is shown below:

```bash
for i in *.JPG;
do mv $i `basename $i JPG`jpg;
done;
```
The first line says find everything with the ".JPG" extension (capitals only, because the UNIX system is case sensitive).

The second line uses basename (type man basename for more details) with the '$i' argument. The '`$i`' is a string containing the name of the file that matches.

The next portion of the line removes the *JPG* extension from the end and adds the *jpg* extention to each file.

The command `mv` is run on the output.

An alternative is:

```bash
for i in *.JPG;
do mv $i ${i%%.JPG}.jpg;
done
```

The above script renames files using a built−in bash function. For more information on bash scripting
you may like to see the [_advanced bash scripting guide,_ authored by Mendel Cooper.](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)

## Administration

### System

#### time

If you are looking for how to change the time please refer to [date](#date)

`time` is a utility to **measure the amount of time it takes a program to execute.**

It also measures CPU usage and displays statistics.

Use `time −v` (verbose mode) to display even more detailed statistics about the particular program.

!!!Example usage:
      time program_name options

#### /proc

The files under the `/proc` **(process information pseudo file−system)** show various information about
the system. Consider it a window to the information that the kernel uses.


!!!example Examples:
      1. Displays information about the CPU.

               cat /proc/cpuinfo

      2. View information about what kernel−modules are loaded on your system.

               less /proc/modules

#### dmesg

Command syntax:

      f −options /dev/hdx

`dmesg` can be used to print (or control) the " **kernel ring buffer".**

`dmesg` is generally used to print the
contents of your _bootup messages_ displayed by the kernel. This is often useful when debugging problems.

Simply type:

      dmesg
      df

Displays information about the space on mounted file−systems.

- `−h` - have df list the space in a 'human readable' format.

The latter part is optional, you can simply use `df` with or without options to list space on all file−systems.


#### who

`who` - Displays information on which users are logged into the system including the time they logged in.

Command syntax:

      who

#### w

`w` - Displays information on who is logged into the system **and what they are doing (ie. the processes they are running)**. It's similar to `who` but displays slightly different information.

Command syntax:

      w

!!!note The `w` command
      The `w` command displays the output of the `uptime` command when you run this command. You could use the `w` command instead of `uptime`.

#### users

`users` - Very similar to `who` except it **only prints out the user names** who are currently logged in. *(Doesn't need or take any options).*

Command syntax:

      users

#### last

`last` - Displays records of when various users have logged in or out.

This includes information on when the
computer was rebooted.

Command syntax:

      last

#### lastlog

`lastlog` - Displays a **list of users and what day/time they logged into the system.**

Command syntax:

      lastlog

#### whoami

`whoami` - Tells the user who they are currently logged in as, this is normally the usename they logged in with
**but can be changed with commands like [su](#su)).**

*whoami* does not need or take any options.

Command syntax:

      whoami

#### uptime

`uptime` - Print how long the computer has been "up", how long the computer has been running.

It also displays the number of users and the processor load (how hard the CPU has been working...).

Command syntax:

      uptime

See also: [`w`](#w)

#### uname

`uname` is used to print _information on the system_ such as **OS type, kernel version et cetera.**

Command syntax:

      uname −options

- `−a`- print all the available information.
- `−m`- print only information related to the machine itself.
- `−n`- print only the machine hostname.
- `−r`- print the release number of the current kernel.
- `−s`- print the operating system name
- `−p`- print the processor type.

#### xargs

`xargs` - is a command used to run other commands as many times as necessary, this way it prevents any kind of overload... When you run a command then add a "| xargs command2". The results of command1 will be passed to
command2, possibly on a line−by−line basis or something similar.

!!!Example Examples:
            ls | xargs grep work
      The first command will list the files in the current directory. For each line of output of `ls`, `xargs` will run `grep` on that particular line and look for the string *"work".* The output have the each time `grep` is executed on a new line, the output would look like:

            file_name: results_of_grep

      If grep didn't find the word then there would be no output

      If it had an error then it will output the error.

      Obviously this isn't very useful (you could just do):

               grep 'word' *


xargs also takes various options:
- `−nx`- will group the first x commands together
- `−lx`- xargs will execute the command for every x number of lines of input
- `−p`- prompt whether or not to execute this particular string
- `−t`- (**t**ell) be verbose, echo each command before performing it
- `−i`- will use substitution similar to `find`'s `−exec` option, it will execute certain commands on something.

!!!examples More Examples:
            s dir1 | xargs −i mv dir1/'{}' dir2/'{}'

      The `{}` would be substituted for the current input (in this example the current `file/directory`) listed within the directory.

      The above command would move every file listed in `dir1` to `dir2`. Obviously this command won't be too useful, it would be easier to go to `dir1` and `type mv * ../dir2`

      Here is a more useful example:

            \ls *.wav | xargs −i lame −h '{}' '{}'.mp3

      This would find all wave files within the current directory and convert them to `mp3` files *(encoded with lame)* and append a `".mp3"` to the end of the filename, unfortunately it doesn't remove the `.wav`and so its not too useful...but it works.

### useradd

    creates a new user

-m - create a home directory for the new user
-s - assings the user to use which default shell- usually followed by the path to the shell `/bin/bash` etc.
-g - which group to assign the user to. `users` is typical
-c - add comments to the user.
-G -assign the user defined group (see man)

`sudo useradd mark -m -s /bin/bash -g users -c "some comments"`

this creates a user without a password.  But cannot login

### passwd

`sudo passwd mark` changes the passwd for mark

`sudo passwd` changes the current user password

`passwd` changes the root password

### userdel

Remove a user from a system

list the users:

        ls /home/

remove a user `sudo userdel username`

removes the username and password, but wont delete a users home directory.

To delete home directory as well

`sudo userdel -r tom`

removes the user directory as well.  May throw an errow with "mailspool"

or `sudo rm -r /home/tom/`

---

### group management

#### groups

`groups` - lists the groups the current user is connected to.

#### see all the groups

`cat /etc/group`

lists all the groups that are available to the groups and shows the users that are attached to the group.

#### groupadd

`groupadd` - adds a group to the end of the groups file

        sudo groupadd Java
        sudo groupadd Cpp
        sudo groupadd Database

 adds a group to the end of the `/etc/group`

## groupdel

`groupdel` - deletes a group

        sudo groupdel Cppp
        cat /etc/group

## Group assignment

Add to the group

        sudo  gpasswd -a username groupname

Remove from the group

        sudo gpasswd -d username groupname

## Bash.rc

bash.rc is a script that is executed each time a terminal that is opened.

        cd ~
        ls -a
        nano bash.rc
        gedit bash.rc

Used for setting alias, setting up environment variables, or listing Git repositories.

### environment variables

The environment is implemented as strings that represent key-value pairs. If multiple values are passed, they are typically separated by colon (:) characters. Each pair will generally look something like this:

      KEY=value1:value2:...

If the value contains significant white-space, quotations are used:

      KEY="value with spaces"

The keys in these scenarios are variables. They can be one of two types, **environmental variables** or **shell variables.**

**Environmental variables** are variables that are defined for the _current shell_ and _are inherited_ by any child shells or processes. **Environmental variables** are used to _pass information_ into processes that are spawned from the shell.

**Shell variables** are variables that are **contained exclusively within the shell** in which they were set or defined. They are often used to keep track of _ephemeral data,_ like the _current working directory._

   !!!note note: By convention, these types of variables are usually defined using _all capital letters._
         This helps users distinguish environmental variables within other contexts.

### env or printenv

`env` or `printenv` will print the environment variables.

The difference between the two commands is only apparent in their more specific functionality. For instance, with `printenv`, you can *request the values of individual variables:*

        printenv SHELL

On the other hand, `env` let's you modify the environment that programs run in by passing a set of variable definitions into a command like this:

        env VAR1="blahblah" command_to_run command_options

### set

The `set` command can be used for this. `set` without any additional parameters,  will list all **shell variables, environmental variables, local variables, and shell functions:**

This is usually a huge list. You probably want to pipe it into a pager program

        set | less

We can clean up the output by specifying that set should *operate in POSIX mode,* which won't print the shell functions. We can execute this in a sub-shell so that it does not change our current environment:

        (set -o posix; set)

This will list all of the environmental and shell variables that are defined.

        comm -23 <(set -o posix; set | sort) <(env | sort)

This will likely still include a few environmental variables, due to the fact that the set command outputs quoted values, while the printenv and env commands do not quote the values of strings.

!!!question - Unsure how this command works...

#### Common Environmental and Shell Variables

Some environmental and shell variables are very useful and are referenced fairly often.
Here are some common environmental variables that you will come across:

- `SHELL`: This describes the shell--in most cases, this will be **bash** but other values can be set if you prefer other options.
- `TERM`: This specifies the type of terminal to emulate when running the shell. Different hardware terminals can be emulated based on requirements.
- `USER`: The current logged in **user.**
- `PWD`: The *current working directory.*
- `OLDPWD`: The *previous working directory.* This is kept by the shell in order to switch back by running `cd -`.
- `LS_COLORS`: This defines color codes that are used to optionally add colored output to the ls command.
- `MAIL`: The path to the current user's mailbox.
- **`PATH`**: A list of directories that the system will check when looking for commands. When a user types in a command, the system will check directories in this order for the executable.
- `LANG`: The current language and localization settings, including character encoding.
- `HOME`: The current user's home directory.
`_`: The most recent previously executed command.
In addition to these environmental variables, some shell variables that you'll often see are:

-`BASHOPTS`: The list of options that were used when bash was executed. This can be useful for finding out if the shell environment will operate in the way you want it to.
-`BASH_VERSION`: The version of bash being executed, in human-readable form.
-`BASH_VERSINFO`: The version of bash, in machine-readable output.
-`COLUMNS`: The number of columns wide that are being used to draw output on the screen.
-`DIRSTACK`: The stack of directories that are available with the pushd and popd commands.
-`HISTFILESIZE`: Number of lines of command history stored to a file.
-`HISTSIZE`: Number of lines of command history allowed in memory.
-`HOSTNAME`: The hostname of the computer at this time.
-`IFS`: The internal field separator to separate input on the command line. By default, this is a space.
-`PS1`: The primary command prompt definition. This is used to define what your prompt looks like when you -start a shell session. The PS2 is used to declare secondary prompts for when a command spans multiple lines.
-`SHELLOPTS`: Shell options that can be set with the set option.
-`UID`: The UID of the current user.


## df

`df` - lists the amount of free disk space on the system.

- `-h` - human readable - puts units after the numbers.

## du

`du` is used to display the disk space used by file or directories.

        cd ~/Downloads
        du
        du -sh /etc/
        sudo du -sh /etc/ **for permission errors


lists all the space taken up by the current directory.


- `-h` - human readable - puts units after the numbers.
- `-s` - **summary** - does not list all the files in a directory.
- `-k` - **k**ilobytes
- `-m` - **m**egabytes
- `-s` - **s**ummarizes each arg (prints totals)
- `-c` - **c**umulative total after completion

Command syntax:

      du −options file_directory_or_files

Examtple:

      du −hs *

This command will list the size of all files in the current directory and the size of subdirectories in human−readable sizes.

If given file permission errors- can use:

        sudo du -sh

To list the space used by the file.

## free

- `free` lists the  memory statistics **(total, free, used, cached, swap).** and swap space used and free.

- `-b` - byte
- `-k` - kilobytes
- `-m` - megabytes
- `-g` - gigabytes
- `-tera` - terabytes.
- `-h` - human readable - puts units after the numbers.
- `-t` - option to display totals of
everything

!!!example Examples:
         free -h
         free −tm

      The **first** will disp mem values in closest human unit.

      The **secomd** will display the memory usage including totals in megabytes

## watch

- `watch` can run linux commands at a regular interval

        watch free -m

Runs `free` every 2.0 seconds (by default)

[[Ctrl]] + [[c]] to exit

        watch -n 1 free -m
        watch -n 0.5 free -m
        watch -df

Runs `free` every 1.0 seconds, 0.5 seconds.

## head

- `head` can be used to output the first part of a file- by default, will print the first 10 lines.

        cd /va/log
        head dmesg

Shows the first 10 lines of the dmesg file.  See [Tail](##tail) for flags

## tail

- `tail` - likewise shows the last (10) lines of a file.

- `-n#` - e.g. '-n3' shows the last 3 lines.
- `-#` - also e.g. '-3' shows the last 3 lines.
- `-f` - **f**ollow - updates the tail/head display as it changes.

        tail -5 -f dmesg

Shows the last 5 lines of dmesg.

        head dmesg kern.log
        tail -3 dmesg kern.log

will show multiple logs sequentially.
## file

- `file` - Attempts to find out what type of file it is, for example it may say it's: **binary,** an **image** file (e.g. **jpeg,** **bmp** etc.), **ASCII text,** **C header** file and many other kinds of files.

Command syntax:

      file file_name

- `-z` - decompress (look inside zipped files)
- `-Z` - decompress (look inside zipped files) but dont give compression info
- `-p` - **p**reserve access time
- `-l` - **l**ist match strength
- `-d` - prints **d**ebug messaging to stderr.
- `-b` - brief output

## stat

- `stat` - Tells you detailed information about a file, including inode number creation/access date. Also has
many advanced options and uses.

For simple use type:

      stat file

## dd

Command syntax:

      dd if=/dev/xxx of=/dev/xxx bs=xxxx count=x

- `dd` - Copies data on a very low level and can be used to create copies of disks and many other things (for example CD image files).

dd can also perform conversions on files and vary the block size used when writing the file.

Command syntax, note the block size and count are optional and you can use files instead of devices...

!!!Warning The command dd is used to work on a very low level.
   It can be used to overwrite important information such as your master−boot record or various important sections
   of your hard−disk. Please be careful when using it (especially when working with devices instead of files)




## find

- `find` command is used to find a folder.

        find /dir -name filename
        find /home/alt -name test.sh
        find /home/alt -name test.*
        find /home/alt -name *.txt
        find /home/alt -name file1*

Accepts wildcards `*`.

        find / -name dmesg

Start in root and look for file dmesg.  This will give a bunch permission denied errors. Use `sudo` to avoid this:

        sudo find / -name dmesg

- `-name` - searches by name
- `-mtime #` - searches by number of days prior. e.g.

        find ~ -mtime 1
        find ~ -mtime -1
        find ~ -mtime +1

First two are equivalent, last one is 1 day in the future.


## wc

- `wc` gives the number of lines/words/characters in a file
ca
        wc test.txt

- `-c` - gives the number of characters
- `-l` - gives the number of lines
- `-w` - gives the number of words
- `-L` - gives the length of the Longest line.

## cal

- `cal` command gives a conventially formatted calendar on the command line.

- `ncal` - gives the transposed version of cal.  (weekday on the rows.)

- `cal 2019` -- gives the whole year
- `cal 3` - gives the calendar for march (cur year)
- `cal -3` - gives the last mo, current and next month.
- `cal -1` - is the essential default.

## date

- `date` command displays or sets the date

        date
        date -s "11/20/2003 12:48:00"
        date +%d%h%y
        date +%d-%h-%y
        date +%d/%h/%y


- `-s`, `--set` **s**ets the date.
- `-d STRING` **d**isplay the time specified by STRING, not *now.*
- `-u`, `--utc` - display UTC

- `+%m` - Specifies the month number
- `+%h` - Specifies the abbreviated month (Jan-Dec)
- `+%B` - Specifies the full month name
- `+%d` - Specifies the day o the month
- `+%y` - Specifies the fyear
- `+%H,+%M,+%S` - Specifies the hour, minute, second
- `+%D` - Specifies the date as **mm/dd/yy**
- `+%T` - Specifies the time as **hh:mm:ss**

can also output in iso8601, rfc2822, rfc-3339 and other formats.  See `man` pages.

## awk

gawk - pattern scanning and processing language - is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.

This is useful for grabbing columns of tabular data.

```sh
space_free=$( df -h | awk '{ print $5 }' | sort -n | tail -n 1 | sed 's/%//' )
#breaking it down
df -h # drive free space - human readable values (tabular data)
awk '{ print $5 }' # gets the 5th column
sort -n #sort descending order
tail -n 1 # get the last one
sed 's/%//'

```

As each input record is read, gawk splits the record into fields, using the value of the FS variable as the field separator. If FS is a single character, fields are separated by that character. If FS is the null string, then each individual character becomes a separate field. Otherwise, FS is expected to be a full regular expression. In the special case that FS is a single space, fields are separated by runs of spaces and/or tabs and/or newlines.

!!!Example:  The Following code gets the wifi networks available, then pipes it to `grep` which finds the active one marked by an asterisk, then uses the default pattern matching, where each spaced field gives another value.

                local signal=$(nmcli device wifi | grep \* | awk '{print $8}')

        The first two commands give:

                *       Timmons               Infra  1     130 Mbit/s  44      ▂▄__  WPA2

        Thus awk '{print $8}` prints the 8th field.

Awk can get very complex

                Usage: awk [POSIX or GNU style options] -f progfile [--] file ...
                Usage: awk [POSIX or GNU style options] [--] 'program' file ...

## Less

Less is used to view man,  its like linux notepad.

[Less Doc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/less)
[SS64 Brief Notes](https://ss64.com/bash/less.html)

| frwrd/down/next | back/up/prev |    | action                                                           |

| z               | w            | ** | move (N1) lines (Nominally 1 window), #z sets N1                 |
| d               | u            | ** | move (N2) lines (Nominally 1/2 window), #d/u sets N2             |
| e j {Enter}     | y k          | *  | move one *(N) line                                               |
| {R arrow}       | {L arrow}    |    | Scroll Sideways                                                  |
| /pattern        | ?pattern     |    | Start a search                                                   |
| n               | N            |    | Go to the next found item                                        |
| M{letter}       | m{letter}    |    | Mark position (A...B...C.etc.) at bottom / top of page. ***      |
| '$              | '^           |    | (Mark syntax) Go to End/Beginn.                                  |
| t               | T            | *  | Go to the next (*Nth) Tag                                        |
| {  (  [         | ]  )  }      | *  | Find the next (*Nth) open/close bracket. Search is rev for Open. |
| :n              | :p           | *  | Examine the next (*Nth) file from command line ****              |


(*) the command can be preceded by an integer to repeat the command N times.  E.g. `5e` moves forward 5 lines.
(**) the command can be preceeded by a number and repeated N times, and also this value is remembered for future commands.  `d` moves forward "1/2 window", but `10d` moves forward 10 lines, and all future presses of `d` by itself will then move 10 lines.  Half height and full height store separate values of N.  You can then type `3z` and have the window advance move just 3 lines, it doesnt have to be more.  Paired commands share a value.

#### Marking

(***) M{letter} marks the bottom and `m` marks at the top.  You can go to a marker by pressing single quote `'` and the desired letter.  `''` (Double single quote) goes back a mark (also `[Ctrl]x, [Ctrl]x`).  Deleta a mark with `[Esc]M<letter>`

Upper case and lower case are distinct.  Some are predefined.

#### Searching

`F` - to the end, `[Esc]F` advances towards end but stops if search string is found. You can also search adjacent files.  See help.

supposedly typing /pattern or ?pattern kicks off a search but it didnt work.  Can be (Needs to be?) preceeded by `!` Non, `*` search multiple files `@` start at first (/) or last (?) file, `[Ctrl]K` highlight only, `[Ctrl]R` Dont use regular expressions.
`/pattern` - Search forward, `?pattern` search back, `n` - next find, `N` Previous.  `&pattern` to show only matching lines.

Maybe its not working bc it expects a regexp.

#### Moving files

`e:` will change to another file.  So will `[Ctrl]X,[Ctrl]V`

`:x` goes to the first file, and `:d` deletes the current file.  `:f` and `=` print the cile name.

`p(%)` or rather `p##` goes to the `##%` point in a file. p50 goes to the halfway point
`r` - rerun screen



`R arrow` - scroll right
`L arrow` - scroll left
`h` open help

#### Options

Miscellaneous Commands:
  -flag           Toggle a command line option [see OPTIONS below].
  --name          Toggle a command line option, by name.

## Network Config

### ifconfig

- `ifconfig` - (Interface Config)-

usually primary is `eth0` - esp for \wired connections.

Link encap - connection method
HWaddr - MAC Address
inet addr - IP Address
Broadcast IP -
Subnet Mask
ipV6 Addr:

Then RX Packets/TX Packets and errors.

to get a specific interface

                ifconfig eth0

#### Turn on or off a specific interface

                sudo ifconfig eth0 down
                sudo ifconfig eth0 up

                Then this disables/enables the interface.
---

### NetworkManager

Seems to have replaced ifconfig

see `man NetworkConfig` or `man nmcli`, or `man nmcli-examples`

`NetworkManager --print-config`

gives the following config statement:
`/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf (lib: 10-dns-resolved.conf, 20-connectivity-pop.conf, 20-connectivity-ubuntu.conf, no-mac-addr-change.conf) (etc: 10-globally-managed-devices.conf, default-wifi-powersave-on.conf)`

Reviewing this-

it appears `Network Manager` calls `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99tlp-rdw-nm` -> which has a few basic scripts and loads two readonly libraries.

Theses are "/usr/share/tlp/tlp-functions &&  tlp-rf-func"

`tlp-functions` has a bunch of constants in it.

It has **CONFFILE**=`/etc/default/tlp`

!!!important - this file actually contains file saving values- such as default off times. tlp - Parameters for power saving

        `/etc/default/tlp`

 - See full explanation: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html

`nmcli c show "Andrew's iPhone"` has many intersting values

GENERAL.CON-PATH:                       /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings/4

but this fixed it:

`nmcli -p c delete "Andrew's iPhone"`

#### Example 2. Showing general information and properties for a Wi-Fi interface

$ nmcli -p -f general,wifi-properties device show wlan0

#### Example 3. Listing NetworkManager polkit permissions

$ nmcli general permissions

#### Example 4. Listing NetworkManager log level and domains

$ nmcli general logging

#### Example 5. Changing NetworkManager logging

$ nmcli g log level DEBUG domains CORE,ETHER,IP
$ nmcli g log level INFO domains DEFAULT

#### Example 6. Activating a VPN connection profile requiring interactive
       password input

$ nmcli --ask con up my-vpn-con

#### Example 7. Adding a bonding master and two slave connection profiles

$ nmcli con add type bond ifname mybond0 mode active-backup
$ nmcli con add type ethernet ifname eth1 master mybond0
$ nmcli con add type ethernet ifname eth2 master mybond0

$ nmcli con add type ethernet con-name Team1-slave1 ifname em1 master Team1
$ nmcli con add type ethernet con-name Team1-slave2 ifname em2 master Team1

The team configuration for the master is read from `team1-master-json.conf file`. Later, you can change the configuration with modify command (`nmcli con modify Team1 team.config team1-master-another-json.conf`).

You will activate the whole setup by activating both slaves:

$ nmcli con up Team1-slave1
$ nmcli con up Team1-slave2

#### Example 9. Adding a bridge and two slave profiles

$ nmcli con add type bridge con-name TowerBridge ifname TowerBridge
$ nmcli con add type ethernet con-name br-slave-1 ifname ens3 master TowerBridge
$ nmcli con add type ethernet con-name br-slave-2 ifname ens4 master TowerBridge
$ nmcli con modify TowerBridge bridge.stp no

#### Example 10. Adding an ethernet connection profile with manual IP
       configuration

```sh
$ nmcli con add con-name my-con-em1 ifname em1 type ethernet \
ip4 192.168.100.100/24 gw4 192.168.100.1 ip4 1.2.3.4 ip6 abbe::ca
fe
$ nmcli con mod my-con-em1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
$ nmcli con mod my-con-em1 +ipv4.dns 1.2.3.4
$ nmcli con mod my-con-em1 ipv6.dns "2001:4860:4860::8888 2001:4860:4860::8844"
$ nmcli -p con show my-con-em1
```

#### Example 14. nmcli usage in a NetworkManager dispatcher script to make Ethernet and Wi-Fi mutually exclusive

```sh
#!/bin/bash
export LC_ALL=C

enable_disable_wifi ()
{
result=$(nmcli dev | grep "ethernet" | grep -w "connected")
if [ -n "$result" ]; then
        nmcli radio wifi off
else
        nmcli radio wifi on
fi
}

if [ "$2" = "up" ]; then
enable_disable_wifi
fi

if [ "$2" = "down" ]; then
enable_disable_wifi
fi

```

### TLP

Power options

see `/etc/default/tlp` and ``

!!!tip Hint use `tlp-stat -p` to show the active driver and available governors.
# Important: powersave for intel_pstate and ondemand for acpi- power efficient for *almost all* workloads and therefore kernal  and most distributions have chosen them as defaults. If you want to change,you should know what you're doing! You *must* disable your distribution's governor settings or conflicts will occur.
#CPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_AC=powersave

!!!note Note you can think of `awk` (gawk) and `grep` as manipulating tabular data- awk gets the columns, grep gets the rows.


## grep

`grep` - is used to search text in a file.'

   Full Documentation
       A [complete manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/) is avail‐
       able.  If the info and grep programs are  properly  installed  at  your
       site, it can be shown with the command

              info grep

example `nmcli device wifi` prints out the wifi networks.  Piping `grep \*` to it finds the line that starts with an asterisk- which is the one that is connected.

another- `ls -l | grep "\.txt$"` runs `ls -l` then pipes it to grep- which will print the lines using the regex `\.txt$`

Command Syntax

                grep -opts "PATTERN" FILE

Case sensitive by default.  Replacing `FILE` with `-` uses StdInput.

A pattern can use `*`, `?`, and `[...]` as wildcards, and `\` to quote a wildcard or backslash character liqterally.


!!!example Example:
                man grep > file.txt
                (1) grep "options" file.txt
                (2) grep "some options" file.txt
                (3) grep "some options" file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt
                (4) grep "some options" ./*
                (5) grep "some options" *
                (6) grep -nv "options" file.txt
                (7) grep "word" -
                (8) gzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H something

        All the lines containing 'options' are printed.  As the second example shows, the result can search for a phrase - not just a word. THe third example demonstrates searching multiple folders. Examples (4) and (5) demonstrate using wildcards to search multiple folders at once. (6)- gives an example showing line numbers and inverting the results (lines that do NOT contain "options"). (7) is an example of searching StdIn using grep. (`-`)

The  colors are  defined  by  the  environment  variable  GREP_COLORS.

        --color[=WHEN] {never|always|auto}


- `-i` - Case **i**nsensitive
- `-n` - Prints the line **n**umber]
- `-v` - In**v**erts the search criteria
- `--help` - help
- `-c` - **C**ount the number of matching lines (`-v` = or non-matching)
- `-l` - just list the files that contain a match
- `-L` - list the files that Do not contain a match.
- `-m #` - a max count after which to stop
- `-H` - print the file name (default with more than one file) in which match was found
- `-h` - DON'T print the file name in which match was found
- `-a` - treat binary file as if it were ASCII
- `-r` - recurse through each file if input arrives at a directory.  Same as `-d recurse`
- `-R` - Same as above- but follow Symbolic links


- `-A #` - Number of lines to show AFTER a match
- `-B #` - Number of lines to show BEFORE a match
- `-C #` - Number of lines to show CENTERING a match

- `-D ACTION`{read|skip} - how to treat devices
- `-d ACTION`{read|skip|recurse} - how to treat directories `-d recurse` == `-r`

- `--exclude=GLOB` - exclude files that match the GLOB.  Only uses the basename
- `--include=GLOB` - only include files that match the GLOB.  Only uses the basename
- `--exclude-from=FILE` - exclude files that match the GLOBs giben in FILE.  Only uses the basename, same as above, but reads a file.
- `--exclude-dir=GLOB` - exclude dirs that match the GLOB.

the variant programs `egrep`, `fgrep` and `rgrep` are the same as `grep -E`, `grep -F`, and `grep -r`,

- `-E`, `--extended-regexp` Interpret  PATTERNS  as  _extended regular expressions (EREs)_
- `-F`, `--fixed-strings`- Interpret PATTERNS as _fixed strings,_ not regular expressions.
- `-G`, `--basic-regexp` - Interpret PATTERNS  as  _basic  regular  expressions  (BREs)_        - **This is the default.**
- `-P`, `--perl-regexp` - Interpret   PATTERNS   as  _Perl-compatible  regular  expressions (PCREs)._
        - This option is experimental _

 grep understands three different versions of regular expression syntax:  **“basic”  (BRE),**  **“extended” (ERE)** and **“perl” (PCRE).**  In GNU grep there is no difference in available functionality between basic and  extended syntaxes.  In other implementations, basic regular expressions are less powerful.

The  following  description  applies  to  extended  regular expressions;  differences  for basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.

Perl-compatible  regular  expressions   give   additional functionality,  and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and pcrepattern(3), but work only if PCRE is available in the system.

## sed

   sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text

                SYNOPSIS - sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...

                DESCRIPTION - Sed  is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

- `-n`, `--quiet`, `--silent` - suppress automatic printing of pattern space
- `--debug` - annotate program execution
- `-e [script]`, `--expression=script` - add the script to the commands to be executed
- `-f [script-file]`, `--file=script-file` - add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed
- `--follow-symlinks` - follow symlinks when processing in place
- `-i[SUFFIX]`, `--in-place[=SUFFIX]` - edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)
- `-l` N, `--line-length=N` - specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command
- `--posix` - disable all GNU extensions.
- `-E`, `-r`, `--regexp-extended` - use extended regular expressions in the script (for portability use `POSIX -E`).
- `-s`, `--separate` - consider files as separate rather than as a single, continuous long stream.
- `--sandbox` - operate in sandbox mode (disable e/r/w commands).
- `-u`, `--unbuffered` - load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the output buffers more often
- `-z`, `--null-data` - separate lines by NUL characters


If no `-e`, `--expression`, `-f`, or `--file` option is given, then the first non-option argument is taken as the sed script to interpret.  All remaining arguments are names of input files; if no input files are specified,  then  the standard input is read.

[GNU sed home page](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)

`ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g` -first the command ls -l is executed, and it's output, instead of being printed, is sent (piped) to the sed program, which in turn, prints what it has to. Which is using regex finds "a, e, i, or o" and replaces with "u"

An example for cleaning dates

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# A date is the first command line argument
clean_date=$( echo $1 | sed 's/[ /:\^#]/-/g' )
echo $clean_date
```



## RegEx (Linux)

- `.` (dot) - any char
- `[]` a range of possible chars for a single match
        - `^` invert the range (NOT e.g `[^0-9]`)
        - predefined ranges:
                - `[:alnum:]` -  alphanumeric
                - `[:alpha:]` - alpjhabetic
                - `[:cntrl:]` - ?Control characters
                - `[:digit:]` - digits
                - `[:graph:]` - ?
                - `[:lower:]` - lowercase
                - `[:print:]` - ?
                - `[:punct:]` - punctuation
                - `[:space:]` - white space
                - `[:upper:]` - upper case
                - `[:xdigit:]` -

!!!note Note: (Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be  included in  addition  to the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.)
                        [^[:alnum:]-$#]
                        ([:alpha:]*) #//wrong- still needs brackets.

!!!note Note: Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket  expressions.
    - To  include  a  literal  [[`]`]] (closing square bracket) place  it **first** in the list.
    - To include a literal [[^]] (caret) place it **anywhere but first.**
    - To include a literal [[-]] (hypen/dash) place it **last.**


!!!warning Interesting Note on Locales (source _man grep_ *"Character Classes...")*
         For example, in the default C locale, [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].  Many locales sort characters in dictionary   order,  and  in  these  locales  [a-d]  is  typically  notequivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to [aBbCcDd], for example.

- `?` - The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
- `*` - The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
- `+` - The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
- `{n}` - The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
- `{n,}` - The preceding item is matched n or more times.
- `{,m}` - The  preceding  item  is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU
        extension.
- `{n,m}` - The preceding item is matched at least n  times,  but  not  more
        than m times.
- `$` anchors at the end of the line
- `^` anchors at the beginning of the line.

            On source:

            scp hello.sh USERNAME@IP.AD.DR.ESS:/home/USERDIR
                then asked for password (remote)

Transfer multiple files over scp

    mkdir test123
    touch test13/{f1.txt,f2.txt,f3.txt}
    ls test123/
    scp -r test123 USERNAME@192.168.1.40:/home/USERNAME
        requests USERNAME's password


from the dest back to source.

### basename

`basename` Print NAME with any leading directory components removed. If specified, also remove a trailing SUFFIX.

                Usage:          basename NAME [SUFFIX]
                or:                     basename OPTION... NAME...

                Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
                -a, --multiple       support multiple arguments and treat each as a NAME
                -s, --suffix=SUFFIX  remove a trailing SUFFIX; implies -a
                -z, --zero           end each output line with NUL, not newline
                --help     display this help and exit
                --version  output version information and exit

                Examples:
                        basename /usr/bin/sort          -> "sort"
                        basename include/stdio.h .h     -> "stdio"
                        basename -s .h include/stdio.h  -> "stdio"
                        basename -a any/str1 any/str2   -> "str1" followed by "str2"

other example:

```sh
    for d in ./ligature/*/ ; do
        build_font $(basename $d)
    done

for value in $1/*.html
do
cp $value $1/$( basename -s .html $value ).php
done

```
