### Work Computer

WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux

## File Structure

- `/` - **Root**
   - `bin` - **Binary** - biinaries are stored here, like *ls* and other things a regular single user might use.
   - `sbin` - System Binaries -- binary tools a system administrator might use.
   - `boot` - boot related files
   - `dev` - devices- devoces are mounted here. along with their drivers.
      - `sda` 
      - `sdb` ... etc- hard disk mounting.
   - `etc` - Et cetera - "edit to configure" mneumonic- system wide settings- not per user settings
     - `network` - network settings location
     - `init.d` - startup directory
   - `home` 
   - `lib`
      -`lib32`, `lib64` - libraries required for bin
   - `media` - Media directory, used to be called `mnt`  or in general most OS'es manage media for you by mounting devices (typically removable devices) while the user can use mount.  Things like USB sticks, external drives are found in `media` or `mnt`;
   - `opt` - contains manually installed software from vendors resides.  Usually user installed software doesnt go here.  But User created software can go here.
   - `proc` - process - Psudofiles that contain info on system processes or resources. Each Process has its own "pseudofile".  These are not actual files.  CPU information is in here.
   - `root` - Root User Home Folder- not a typical user directory.  Files stored here require root access.  This was to make sure that if user directories were on another directory, it wouldnt be lost.
   - `run` - variable- TempFS file system- like a temp directory.  It is stored in Ram and lost when the computer reboots.
   - `snap` -Snap Package directory- where Ubuntu stores the Snap packages.
   - `srv` - Service Directory- usually empty, but if computer is a webserver- then website or FTP files are stored here.
   - `sys` - System Files- contains Kernal pseudofiles.  It is not permanent.  Allows very low level access to kernal- for things like updating Video Card Settings.
   - `tmp` - Temporary- this is for applications to use during a session- things like temproray copies of a Document in progress.  A crashed program may lose access to the folder and it can begin to fill.  Might need to be cleared by Root user in Single User Mode.
   - `usr` - User or Unix System Resources - holds applications installed by the user.  These must be considered  non-essential.
      - `bin` - binaries
      - `sbin`- administration binaries
      - `lib` - libraries., also `lib32` and `lib64`
      - `src` Source - where programs installed from source are stored.
      - `local` - to indicate machine local users--
         - `bin` - binaries
         - `sbin`- administration binaries
         - `lib` - libraries., also `lib32` and `lib64`
         - `src` Source - where programs installed from source are stored.
      - `share` - The site for larger program installs.
         - `bin` - binaries
         - `sbin`- administration binaries
         - `lib` - libraries., also `lib32` and `lib64`
         - `src` Source - where programs installed from source are stored.
         - `local` - to indicate machine local users--
            - `bin` - binaries
            - `sbin`- administration binaries
            - `lib` - libraries., also `lib32` and `lib64`
            - `src` Source - where programs installed from source are stored.
   - `var` - Variable -this folder contains files that are expected to grow in size
      - `log` - contains log files
      - `crash` contains information on crashes.
      - `spool` contains printer documents
      - `cache` contains cached folders
   - `home` - links variably to each users home directory.
      - `.cache` - stores program cache
      - `.config` - Application (user specific) configuration settings.  Desktop settings, etc.
      - `.themes` - Desktop Themes.
      - `.*` - hidden files for programs.
    

## File permissions

Get user and group information:

cat /etc/passwd

      root:x:0:0:Console and webGui login account:/root:/bin/bash
      bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/false
      daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/bin/false
      adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/log:/bin/false
      lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/bin/false
      ...

Gives the 
    [User]:[?]:[UID]:[GUID]:Description:Home:[Default Shell]

Can use /bin/false as a null value.

      ls -l dirname
      drwxr-xr-x 12 linuxize users 4.0K Apr  8 20:51 dirname
      |[-][-][-]    [------] [---]
      | |  |  |        |       |       
      | |  |  |        |       +-----------> Group
      | |  |  |        +-------------------> Owner
      | |  |  +----------------------------> Others Permissions
      | |  +-------------------------------> Group Permissions
      | +----------------------------------> Owner Permissions
      +------------------------------------> File Type

By default, on Linux systems, the default creation permissions are **666 for files,** which gives read and write permission to user, group, and others, and to **777 for directories,** which means read, write and execute permission to user, group, and others. Linux does not allow a file to be created with execute permissions.

The default creation permissions can be modified using the `umask` utility.

`umask` affects **only the current shell environment.** On most Linux distributions the default system-wide umask value is set in the *pam_umask.so* or */etc/profile file.*

If you want to specify a different value on per-user basis edit the user’s shell configuration files such as *~/.bashrc* or *~/.zshrc.* You can also change the current session umask value by running umask followed by the desired value.

To view the current mask value, simply type umask without any arguments:

        root@Unraid:~# umask
      0000

    
The umask value contains the permission bits that will **NOT** be set on the newly created files and directories.  (777 = 000) Logical NOT each octal


Basically its {`d`/`-`}(`u`ser)`rwx`(`g`roup)`rwx`( `o`thers)`rwx` w/ `-` turning it off.
Access Levels
- None (-)
- read (r)
- write (w)
- execute (x)



You can see these by using the `ls -l` Unix command.

0123456789

`drwxr-xr-x`

`-rwxr-xr-x`

`-rwxrwxrwx`

The first character represents the entry type.  The entry type for a directory is 'd'.  

All files have a hyphen (-) as their entry type.  The remaining nine characters indicate the permissions themselves in 3 groups of three.  

1 through 3 show user (u) permissions;
4 through 6 are group (g) permissions;
7 through 9 are other (o) permissions (users who are not the owner and are not members of the group own the file/directory, a.k.a. "the world"). 

can also take away the read and write permissions by doing the following:

chmod o-rw /home/yourusername

### CHMOD

to give the world permission to read and write to your home directory, then you would use the command below:

chmod o+rw /home/youruserna




## Path

`code ~/.bashrc`

`alias python ='/usr/bin/python3.7'`

## Useful commands

- `lscpu` - reports information about the cpu and processing units
- `lshw`-  reports detailed and brief information about multiple different hardware units such as cpu, memory, disk, usb controllers, network adapters etc. Lshw extracts the information from different /proc files.
- `hwinfo` - report detailed and brief information about multiple different hardware components, and more than what lshw can report.
- `lspci` -  lists out all the pci buses and details about the devices connected to them. The vga adapter, graphics card, network adapter, usb ports, sata controllers, etc all fall under this category.
- `lsscsi` -Lists out the scsi/sata devices like hard drives and optical drives.
- `lsusb` - hows the USB controllers and details about devices connected to them. 
  -  Use the verbose option `-v` to print detailed information about each usb port
- `inxi` -  Inxi is a 10K line mega bash script that fetches hardware details from multiple different sources and commands on the system, and generates a beautiful looking report that non technical users can read easily.
- `lsblk`- List out information all block devices, which are the hard drive partitions and other storage devices like optical drives and flash drives
- `df` - Reports various partitions, their mount points and the used and available space on each.
- `pydf` - improved version of the above.
- `fdisk` -  modify parts and list out parts.
- `mount` - The mount is used to mount/unmount and view mounted file systems.

```
requires toilet package

### tput

 tput setb 4 -sets the bg color

### Quick Tips

A collection of short (1 liner or so) quick bash commands

- `sudo !!`  redo last command but as root

- Open an editor to run a command
  `ctrl+x+e`

- create a super fast ram disk
  `mkdir -p /mnt/ram`
  `mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/ram -o size=8192M`
- Then test it by creating a blockfile
      `dd if=/dev/zero of=test.-0iso bs=1M count=8000`
      `rm test.iso`
      `mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/ram -o size=8192M`
      `cd ram/`
- Don't add command to history **(note the leading space)**
  `_ls -l` - Underscore added for clarity
    -Show the history
      `history`
    -clear the screen
      `clear`
- fix a really long command that you messed up
  `fc`
- tunnel with ssh (local port 3337 -> remote host's 127.0.0.1 on port 6379)
  `ssh -L 3337:127.0.0.1:6379 root@emkc.org -N`
  `bg`
  `redis-cli -p 3337`

Not sure I understand this fully. SSH is opened on 3337 to connect to 127...via 6379, followed by a login?I think the redis-cli is to demonstrate its success.

-quickly create folders
`mkdir -p folder/{sub1,sub2}/{subA,subB,subC}`
$/1/A,/1/B...3/C/

- Create folders 1 through 10 each with 10 folders in it.
`mkdir -p folder/{1..10}/{1..10}`

-intercept stdout and log to file
`cat file | tee -a log | cat > /dev/null`
-exit terminal but leave all processes running
`disown -a && exit`
-Use the last term of the last command- !$
  `!$`
    `$ mkdir -p /path/to/new/dir`
    `$ cd !$`

- Set the hostname
`hostname`
`hostname -f` fully qualified domain name

Set the timezone
`dpkg-reconfigure tzdata #Debian/Ubuntu`
`timedatectl list-timezones #CentOS or ArchLinux`
`timedatectl set-timezone 'America/Chicago'`

Find the appropriate zone file in /usr/share/zoneinfo/ and link that file to /etc/localtime. See the examples below for possibilities:
`ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/EST /etc/localtime`
`ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Eastern /etc/localtime`

`/etc/hosts`
`mtr #track the speed of a connection between two connections`
`mtr --report`

- Check memory usage
`free -m`

- Monitor IO usage with vmstat -runs a vmstat every second x 20
`vmstat 1 20`

- Monitor processes, memory and CPU  - commands for various distros below
`apt-get install htop`
`yum install htop`
`pacman -S htop`
`emerge sys-process/htop`
  - to run
  `htop`
  - quit with F10 or Q, run 'setup' with F2, Show tree view with F5

### Kill App

press [[Ctrl]]+[[Z]] to suspend the script, then `kill %%`{style="font-style:Courier"}

The `%%` tells the bash built-in kill that you want to send a signal (`SIGTERM` by default) to the most recently suspended background job in the current shell, not to a process-id.

### System Summary (inxi)

`inxi -Fxxxz`

Provides a summary of the system, often for sharing on forums and such.

- `-F` is "all",  each x is a verbosity level
- `-H` will provide help
- `-A` audio
- `-C` cpu
- `-D`, -Dd Disk / optical
- `-G` graphics

## man - Get the Manual

`man` gets the manual

The manual has 8 main sections-

1. Executable programs or shell commands
2. System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
3. Library calls (functions within program libraries)
4. Special files (usually found in /dev)
5. File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
6. Games
7. Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
8. System administration commands (usually only for root)
9. Kernel routines [Non standard]

Ok 9. This is the number in the [command] help >> see command(#) bit.

Ironically, `man man` gets help with the manual.


## at

This also works (Examples to achieve a similar effect without at - it made sense for what I was doing at the time.)

      (sleep 10 ; echo "test" > ./testfile ) &

      (sleep 5 ; echo 'test\n' ) > /dev/stdout 2>&1  &

      (sleep 10 ; cat /boot/config/bashcustom >> /root/.bash_profile; echo "done")>/dev/stdout &

      (sleep 10 ; cat /boot/config/bashcustom >> /root/.bash_profile; source ~/.bash_profile; echo "done")>/dev/stdout &



for multiple commands using a file and at is better

The & makes it detach into the background
The parentheses makes sure they run together.

`at -m 01:35 < my-at-jobs.txt`  Run the commands listed in the 'my-at-jobs.txt' file at 1:35 AM.

at


- `at` - executes commands at a specified time.
- `atq` - lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser; in that case, everybody's jobs are listed. The format of the output lines (one for each job) is: job number, date, hour, year, queue, and username.
- `atrm` - deletes jobs, identified by their job number.
- `batch` - executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops below 1.5, or the value specified in the invocation of atd.

## Less

Less is used to view man,  its like linux notepad.

[Less Doc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/less)
[SS64 Brief Notes](https://ss64.com/bash/less.html)

| frwrd/down/next | back/up/prev |    | action                                                           |

| g   <           | G   >        |    | TO beginning or End                                              |
| f {space}       | b            | *  | move one window                                                  |
| z               | w            | ** | move (N1) lines (Nominally 1 window), #z sets N1                 |
| d               | u            | ** | move (N2) lines (Nominally 1/2 window), #d/u sets N2             |
| e j {Enter}     | y k          | *  | move one *(N) line                                               |
| {R arrow}       | {L arrow}    |    | Scroll Sideways                                                  |
| /pattern        | ?pattern     |    | Start a search                                                   |
| n               | N            |    | Go to the next found item                                        |
| M{letter}       | m{letter}    |    | Mark position (A...B...C.etc.) at bottom / top of page. ***      |
| '$              | '^           |    | (Mark syntax) Go to End/Beginn.                                  |
| t               | T            | *  | Go to the next (*Nth) Tag                                        |
| {  (  [         | ]  )  }      | *  | Find the next (*Nth) open/close bracket. Search is rev for Open. |
| :n              | :p           | *  | Examine the next (*Nth) file from command line ****              |


(*) the command can be preceded by an integer to repeat the command N times.  E.g. `5e` moves forward 5 lines.
(**) the command can be preceeded by a number and repeated N times, and also this value is remembered for future commands.  `d` moves forward "1/2 window", but `10d` moves forward 10 lines, and all future presses of `d` by itself will then move 10 lines.  Half height and full height store separate values of N.  You can then type `3z` and have the window advance move just 3 lines, it doesnt have to be more.  Paired commands share a value.

#### Marking

(***) M{letter} marks the bottom and `m` marks at the top.  You can go to a marker by pressing single quote `'` and the desired letter.  `''` (Double single quote) goes back a mark (also `[Ctrl]x, [Ctrl]x`).  Deleta a mark with `[Esc]M<letter>`

Upper case and lower case are distinct.  Some are predefined.

#### Searching

`F` - to the end, `[Esc]F` advances towards end but stops if search string is found. You can also search adjacent files.  See help.

supposedly typing /pattern or ?pattern kicks off a search but it didnt work.  Can be (Needs to be?) preceeded by `!` Non, `*` search multiple files `@` start at first (/) or last (?) file, `[Ctrl]K` highlight only, `[Ctrl]R` Dont use regular expressions.
`/pattern` - Search forward, `?pattern` search back, `n` - next find, `N` Previous.  `&pattern` to show only matching lines.

Maybe its not working bc it expects a regexp.

#### Moving files

`e:` will change to another file.  So will `[Ctrl]X,[Ctrl]V`

`:x` goes to the first file, and `:d` deletes the current file.  `:f` and `=` print the cile name.

`p(%)` or rather `p##` goes to the `##%` point in a file. p50 goes to the halfway point
`r` - rerun screen



`R arrow` - scroll right
`L arrow` - scroll left
`h` open help

#### Options

Miscellaneous Commands:
  -flag           Toggle a command line option [see OPTIONS below].
  --name          Toggle a command line option, by name.
  _flag           Display the setting of a command line option.
  __name          Display the setting of an option, by name.
  +cmd        Execute the less cmd each time a new file is examined.

  !command    Execute the shell command with $SHELL.
  |Xcommand   Pipe file between current pos & mark X to shell command.
  v           Edit the current file with $VISUAL or $EDITOR.
  V           Print version number of "less".
  [flag]^P (CONTROL-P)  Suppress change message

OPTIONS:
Most options can be changed either on the command line, or from within less by using the - or -- command.
Options can be given in one of two forms: either a single character preceded by a -, or a name preceeded by --.

### more

Display output one screen at a time, less provides more emulation and extensive enhancements.

#### Syntax

     `more [-dlfpcsu] [-num] [+/ pattern] [+ linenum] [file ...]
`
#### Options

  Command line options are described below.  Options are also taken from the environment variable MORE (make sure to precede them with a dash (``-'')) but command line options will override them.
- `-num`  This option specifies an integer which is the screen size (in lines).
- `-d`    more will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]" and will display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" instead of ringing the bell when an illegal key is pressed.
- `-l`    more usually treats ^L (form feed) as a special character, and will pause after any line that contains a form feed.  The -l option will prevent this behavior.
- `-f`    Causes more to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long lines are not folded).
- `-p`    Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display the text.
- `-c`    Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.
- `-s`    Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.
- `-u`    Suppress underlining.
- `+/`    The +/ option specifies a string that will be searched for before each file is displayed.
- `+num`  Start at line number num.

#### COMMANDS

  Interactive commands for more are based on vi(1).  Some commands can be preceeded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions below.  In the following descriptions, `^X` means control-X.

- `h`, `?`      Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all the other commands, remember this one.
- `SPACE`       Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen size.
- `z`           Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen size.  Argument becomes new default.
- `RETURN`      Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to 1. Argument becomes new default.
- `d`, `^D`     Scroll k lines.  Default is current scroll size, initially 1.   Argument becomes new default.
- `q`, `Q`,
  - `INTERRUPT` Exits the more command.
- `s`           Skip forward k lines of text.  Defaults to 1.
- `f`           Skip forward k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.
- `b`, `^B`     Skip backwards k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.
- `'`           Go to place where previous search started.
- `=`           Display current line number.
- `/pattern`    Search for kth occurrence of regular expression. Defaults to 1.
- `n`           Search for kth occurrence of last r.e.  Defaults to 1.
- `!`, `:!`     Execute  in a subshell
- `v`           Start up /usr/bin/vi at current line
- `^L`          Redraw screen
- `:n`          Go to kth next file.  Defaults to 1.
- `:p`          Go to kth previous file.  Defaults to 1.
- `:f`          Display current file name and line number
- `.`           Repeat previous command

#### ENVIRONMENT

  More utilizes the following environment variables, if they exist:

  MORE        This variable can be set with favored options to more.
  SHELL       Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login

### Converting Paths

[StackExchange Article](https://askubuntu.com/questions/900283/windows-filepath-converted-to-linux-filepath)

```bash
file=${file/C://c}
file=${file//\\//}
echo $file

#Rewritten As
file=${file/C://c}
file=${file//\\//}

#Using Filenames as an array
filenames=(
  'C:\Users\abcd\Downloads\testingFile.log'
  # ... add more here ...
)

for f in "${filenames[@]}"; do
  f="${f/C://c}"
  f="${f//\\//}"
  echo "$f"
done

```


If you want to put the output into an array instead of printing, replace the echo line with an assignment:


```bash

  filenames_out+=( "$f" )

#Shell Function
win2lin () { f="${1/C://c}"; printf '%s\n' "${f//\\//}"; }

$ file='C:\Users\abcd\Downloads\testingFile.log'
$ win2lin "$file"
/c/Users/abcd/Downloads/testingFile.log
$ file='C:\Users\pqrs\Documents\foobar'
$ win2lin "$file"
/c/Users/pqrs/Documents/foobar

#Option3
file="$(echo "$file" | sed -r -e 's|^C:|/c|' -e 's|\\|/|g')"

#or
file="$(sed 's|^C:|/c|; s|\\|/|g' <<< "$file")"

#Or Using tr
file="/$(echo 'C:\Users\abcd\Downloads\testingFile.log'|tr '^C' 'c'|tr '\\' '/')"

file="/mnt/$(echo $file|tr '^C' 'c'|tr '^D' 'd'|tr '^E' 'e'|tr '^F' 'f'|tr '^G' 'g'|tr '^H' 'h'|tr 'q^I' 'i'|tr '^J' 'j'|tr '^K' 'k'|tr '^L' 'l'|tr '^M' 'm'|tr '^N' 'n'|tr '^O' 'o'|tr '^P' 'p'|tr '^Q' 'q'|tr '^R' 'r'|tr '^S' 's'|tr '^T' 't'|tr '^U' 'u'|tr '^V' 'v'|tr '^W' 'w'|tr '^X' 'x'|tr '^Y' 'y'|tr '^Z' 'z'|tr '^A' 'a'|tr '^B' 'b'|tr '\\' '/')"

## IPCS

`ipcs` shows information on the inter-process communication facilities for which the calling process has read access. By default, it shows information about all three resources: shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphore arrays.

Without options, the information shall be written in short format for message queues, shared memory segments, and semaphore sets that are currently active in the system. Otherwise, the information that is displayed is controlled by the options specified.

Options :

- `-q` : Write information about active message queues.
- `-m` : Write information about active shared memory segments.
- `-s` : Write information about active semaphore sets.
- `-a`  : Use all print options. (This is a shorthand notation for -b, -c, -o, -p, and -t.)
- `-b`  : Write information on maximum allowable size. (Maximum number of bytes in messages on queue for message queues, size of segments for shared memory, and number of semaphores in each set for semaphores.)
- `-c`  : Write creator’s user name and group name;.
- `-o`  : Write information on outstanding usage. (Number of messages on queue and total number of bytes in messages on queue for message queues, and number of processes attached to shared memory segments.)
- `-p`  : Write process number information. (Process ID of the last process to send a message and process ID of the last process to receive a message on message queues, process ID of the creating process, and process ID of the last process to attach or detach on shared memory segments.)
- `-t`  : Write time information. (Time of the last control operation that changed the access permissions for all facilities, time of the last msgsnd() and msgrcv() operations on message queues, time of the last shmat() and shmdt() operations on shared 

## IP

Rather important little program.  Does a TON of stuff.

Has a large slew of options.  I think commands like route etc, just are synonyms for this.

### Figure out how you are connecting

`ip route get`

    root@Unraid:~# ip route get 8.8.8.8 
    8.8.8.8 via 192.168.1.1 dev br1 src 192.168.1.241 uid 0 
        cache 

I have this command stored in my notes, unsure what it does:

      ip route get 8.8.8.8 | sed -n 's/.*dev \([^\ ]*\) table.*/\1/p'

Much of the following is copied without modification from the 1st source.

The rsync utility expressions take the following form:

Local to Local:  `rsync [OPTION]... [SRC]... DEST`
Local to Remote: `rsync [OPTION]... [SRC]... [USER@]HOST:DEST`
Remote to Local: `rsync [OPTION]... [USER@]HOST:SRC... [DEST]`


|Options | Description|
|-------|------------|
| -r |sync data recursively, does not keep ownership, permissions, timestamps, or  symlinks. |
| -a | like the recursive mode,+keeps permissions, symlinks, ownership, etc. |
| -z | compress data during transfers to save space. |
| -b |	Performs a backup during data synchronization.|
| -h | Shows the numbers in the output in a human-readable format.|
| -n | Does a dry run. Used for testing before the actual synchronization takes place.|
| -e | use the SSH protocol for remote transfers.|
| –progress	| Displays the transfer progress during synchronization.|
| -v | Verbose output. Displays the details of the transfer.|
| -q |Used to suppress the output for the rsync command and options.|


It is worth mentioning that rsync gives different treatment to the source directories with a trailing slash (/). 

If the source directory has a trailing slash, the command will copy only the directory contents to the destination directory. 

When the trailing slash is omitted, rsync copies the source directory **inside** the destination directory.

### Options 

#### -a, --archive, 

archive mode, equivalent to `-rlptgoD`. This option tells rsync to syncs directories recursively, transfer special and block devices, preserve symbolic links, modification times, groups, ownership, and permissions.

#### -P

equivalent to --partial --progress. When this option is used, rsync shows a progress bar during the transfer and keeps the partially transferred files. It is useful when transferring large files over slow or unstable network connections.

#### --append

This causes rsync to update a file by appending data onto the end of the file, which presumes that the data that already exists on the receiving side is identical with the start of the file on the sending side. If a file needs to be transferred and its size on the receiver is the same or longer than the size on the sender, the file is skipped. This does not interfere with the updating of a file's non-content attributes (e.g., permissions, ownership, etc.) when the file does not need to be transferred, nor does it affect the updating of any non-regular files. Implies --inplace, but does not conflict with --sparse (since it is always extending a file's length).

This would only seem to make sense for text files.

#### --existing, --ignore-non-existing

This tells rsync to skip creating files (including directories) that do not exist yet on the destination. If this option is combined with the --ignore-existing option, no files will be updated (which can be useful if all you want to do is delete extraneous files).

This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus it doesn’t affect deletions. It just limits the files that the receiver requests to be transferred.

#### --ignore-existing

This tells rsync to skip updating files that already exist on the destination (this does not ignore existing directories, or nothing would get done). See also --existing.

This option is a transfer rule, not an exclude, so it doesn’t affect the data that goes into the file-lists, and thus it doesn’t affect deletions. It just limits the files that the receiver requests to be transferred.

This option can be useful for those doing backups using the --link-dest option when they need to continue a backup run that got interrupted. Since a --link-dest run is copied into a new directory hierarchy (when it is used properly), using --ignore existing will ensure that the already-handled files don’t get tweaked (which avoids a change in permissions on the hard-linked files). This does mean that this option is only looking at the existing files in the destination hierarchy itself

#### --delete

This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side (ones that aren’t on the sending side), but only for the directories that are being synchronized. You must have asked rsync to send the whole directory (e.g., "dir" or "dir/") without using a wildcard for the directory's contents (e.g., "dir/*") since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and rsync thus gets a request to transfer individual files, not the files’ parent directory. Files that are excluded from the transfer are also excluded from being deleted unless you use the --delete-excluded option or mark the rules as only matching on the sending side (see the include/exclude modifiers in the FILTER RULES section). Prior to rsync 2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless --recursive was enabled. Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions will also occur when --dirs (-d) is enabled, but only for directories whose contents are being copied.

This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly. It is a very good idea to first try a run using the --dry-run option (-n) to see what files are going to be deleted.

If the sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion of any files at the destination will be automatically disabled. This is to prevent temporary filesystem failures (such as NFS errors) on the sending side from causing a massive deletion of files on the destination. You can override this with the --ignore-errors option.

The --delete option may be combined with one of the --delete-WHEN options without conflict, as well as --delete-excluded. However, if none of the --delete-WHEN options are specified, rsync will choose the --delete-during algorithm when talking to rsync 3.0.0 or newer, and the --delete-before algorithm when talking to an older rsync. See also --delete-delay and --delete-after.

#### -z, --compress

With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent to the destination machine, which reduces the amount of data being transmitted; something that is useful over a slow connection.

Note that this option typically achieves better compression ratios than can be achieved by using a compressing remote shell or a compressing transport because it takes advantage of the implicit information in the matching data blocks that are not explicitly sent over the connection.

See the --skip-compress option for the default list of file suffixes that will not be compressed.

#### -i, --itemize-changes

Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each file, including attribute changes. This is exactly the same as specifying --out-format='%i %n%L'. If you repeat the option, unchanged files will also be output, but only if the receiving rsync is at least version 2.6.7 (you can use -vv with older versions of rsync, but that also turns on the output of other verbose messages).

The "%i" escape has a cryptic output that is 11 letters long. The general format is like the string YXcstpoguax, where Y is replaced by the type of update being done, X is replaced by the file-type, and the other letters represent attributes that may be output if they are being modified.

The update types that replace the Y are as follows:

`<` means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).
`>` means that a file is being transferred to the local host (received).
- `c` -  means that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such as the creation of a directory or the changing of a symlink, etc.).
- `h` -  means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires --hard-links).
- `.` -  means that the item is not being updated (though it might have attributes that are being modified).
- `*` -  means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains a message (e.g., "deleting").
The file-types that replace the X are: f for a file, a `d` for a directory, an `L` for a symlink, a `D` for a device, and a `S` for a special file (e.g., named sockets and fifos).

The other letters in the string above are the actual letters that will be output if the associated attribute for the item is being updated or a "." for no change. Three exceptions to this are:

a newly created item replaces each letter with a "`+"`,
an identical item replaces the dots with spaces, and
an unknown attribute replaces each letter with a "`?`" (this can happen when talking to an older rsync).
The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:

- `c` -  means either that a regular file has a different checksum (requires --checksum) or that a symlink, device, or special file has a changed value. Note that if you are sending files to an rsync prior to 3.0.1, this change flag will be present only for checksum-differing regular files.
- `s` -  means the size of a regular file is different and will be updated by the file transfer.
- `t` -  means the modification time is different and is being updated to the sender's value (requires --times). An alternate value of T means that the modification time will be set to the transfer time, which happens when a file/symlink/device is updated without --times and when a symlink is changed and the receiver can’t set its time. Note: when using an rsync 3.0.0 client, you might see the s flag combined with t instead of the proper T flag for this time-setting failure.
- `p` -  means the permissions are different and are being updated to the sender's value (requires --perms).
- `o` -  means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender's value (requires --owner and super-user privileges).
- `g` -  means the group is different and is being updated to the sender's value (requires --group and the authority to set the group).
- `u` -  slot is reserved for future use.
- `a` -  means that the ACL information changed.
- `x` -  means that the extended attribute information changed.

One other output is possible: when deleting files, the "`%i`" will output the string "`*deleting`" for each item that is being removed (assuming that you are talking to a recent enough rsync that it logs deletions instead of outputting them as a verbose message).


#### --stats

This tells rsync to print a verbose set of statistics on the file transfer, allowing you to tell how effective rsync's delta-transfer algorithm is for your data.

#### -m, --prune-empty-dirs

This option tells the receiving rsync to get rid of empty directories from the file-list, including nested directories that have no non-directory children. This is useful for avoiding the creation of a bunch of useless directories when the sending rsync is recursively scanning a hierarchy of files using include/exclude/filter rules.

### Examples 

#### Copy a single file

    rsync -v /home/test/Desktop/sample.txt /home/test/Desktop/rsync/

in this example, a file name backup.tar needs to be copied or synced to /tmp/backups/ folder.

    root@tecmint]# rsync -zvh backup.tar /tmp/backups/

      created directory /tmp/backups

      backup.tar

      sent 14.71M bytes  received 31 bytes  3.27M bytes/sec

      total size is 16.18M  speedup is 1.10

#### Copy Multiple Files Locally


To copy multiple files with rsync, add full paths of the source files:

    rsync -v /home/test/Desktop/sample.txt /home/test/Desktop/sample2rs.txt /home/test/Desktop/rsync


#### Copy a Directory and All Subdirectories Locally (Copy Files and Directories Recursively)

To copy a directory and its contents to another location on your machine, use the -a or -r option. We used the archive option:

    rsync -av /home/test/Desktop/Linux /home/test/Desktop/rsync


#### Copy a File or Directory from Local to Remote Machine
To copy the directory /home/test/Desktop/Linux to /home/test/Desktop/rsync on a remote machine, you need to specify the IP address of the destination.

Add the IP address and the destination after the source directory. Remember to put a colon (:) after the remote host’s IP address, with no spaces before the destination.

The command looks like this:

    rsync -av /home/test/Desktop/Linux 192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop/rsync

Enter the password for the current user to continue. If you want to use another account for the remote connection, specify it before the IP address:

    rsync -a /home/test/Desktop/Linux jay@192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop/rsync

To copy a single file to a remote host, specify the full path of the file and the destination.

    rsync -av /home/test/Desktop/sample_file.txt 192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop/rsync

#### Specify rsync Protocol for Remote Transfers

The rsync tool can be instructed with the -e option to use a specific protocol for file transfers. To use Rsync over SSH to transfer files remotely, append -e ssh to the rsync command.

For example, to transfer sample.txt from your desktop to the desktop of a remote machine:

    rsync -e ssh /home/test/Desktop/sample.txt 192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop

#### Delete a Nonexistent Source File or Directory from Destination
  
Use the `--delete` option to keep the source and the target in sync.

This option tells rsync to delete any file or directory at the destination if the source does not have it.

    rsync -av --delete /home/test/Desktop/Dir1 192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop/rsync

If a file or directory not exist at the source, but already exists at the destination, you might want to delete that existing file/directory at the target while syncing .

We can use ‘–delete‘ option to delete files that are not there in source directory.

Source and target are in sync. Now creating new file test.txt at the target.

    [root@tecmint]# touch test.txt
    [root@tecmint]# rsync -avz --delete root@192.168.0.100:/var/lib/rpm/ .
    Password:
    receiving file list ... done
    deleting test.txt
    ./
    sent 26 bytes  received 390 bytes  48.94 bytes/sec
    total size is 45305958  speedup is 108908.55

#### Delete Source Files After Transfer

In some scenarios, you may want to delete the source files after the transfer. For example, you may be moving a weekly backup to a new server. Once the transfer is done, you no longer need the source files on the old server.

In that case, use the `--remove-source-files` flag to delete the source file you specified.

For example, this command transfers the backup file weekly.zip and then deletes it from the source:

    rsync -v --remove-source-files /home/test/backup/weekly.zip 192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop/rsync/


#### Set Maximum File Size for Transfer

To determine the maximum file size that rsync will transfer, use the `--max-size=add_size`.

For example, to transfer files no larger than 500KB, use this command:

    rsync -av --max-size=500k /home/test/Desktop/Dir1 192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop/rsync/

And to Set Minimum File Size for Transfer

Use `--min-size=add_size` with rsync when you do not want to transfer files smaller than the size you specify. This option is useful, for example, when you want to skip small log or thumbnail files.

To skip any file smaller than 10KB, run this command:

    rsync -av --min-size=10k /home/test/Desktop/ 192.168.56.100:/home/test/Desktop/rsync/

#### Copy Directory Structure but Skip Files

Rsync allows you to transfer only directory structure if you do not need the files at another location.

To do so, add `-f"+ */" -f"- *"` before the source directory.

For example, to copy the structure of the Linux directory to Documents, enter:

    rsync -av -f"+ */" -f"- *"  /home/test/Desktop/Linux /home/test/Documents


#### Add Date Stamp to Directory Name

You can easily add a date to a directory name if you want to put a date stamp to your transfers.

Append $(date +\\%Y-\\%m-\\%d) to the destination directory name you want to create. This option is useful when you want to keep track of when transfers took place without opening directory properties.

For example:

    rsync -av /home/test/Desktop/Linux /home/test/Desktop/rsync$(date +\\%Y-\\%m-\\%d)

#### Do Not Copy Source File if the Same Destination File is Modified

If you keep in sync two directories, rsync does not copy a file if the same one exists at the destination.

Sometimes it may happen that you modify a file at the destination and do not want to let rsync overwrite it.

To avoid overwriting modified destination files, use the `-u` option.

For example:

    rsync -avu /home/test/Desktop/Linux/ /home/test/Desktop/rsync

#### Show the Difference Between the Source and Destination Files

When you start transferring data, you can use the -i flag with rsync to check if there is a difference between the source and the destination.

For example:

    rsync -avi /home/test/Desktop/Linux/ /home/test/Desktop/rsync

Terminal with the output for the `-i` rsync option.

(Image shows:)

    >f++++++++++ sample2rs.txt


The example above shows the sample2rs.txt file is missing at the destination.

Possible letters in the output are:

    f – stands for file
    d – shows the destination file is in question
    t – shows the timestamp has changed
    s – shows the size has changed

### My Usage Examples

### Sync all the files 

rsync -rlthP --stats SRC /mnt/disks/Elements/ DEST .
rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --exclude '__Huge/*' --dry-run  /mnt/disks/Seagate_Expansion_Drive  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Seagate_Expansion_Drive
`rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --exclude '__Huge/*' /mnt/disks/Seagate_Expansion_Drive  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Seagate_Expansion_Drive`

`rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --exclude '__Huge/*' --exclude 'X\ backup*'  /mnt/disks/Elements/  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Elements/`

`rsync -rlthP --stats --size-only --progress --del  /mnt/disks/Elements/  /mnt/user/rDriveA/Elements/`

## tar

[Source](https://www.adminschoice.com/backup-commands-examples)


tar features:
1. tar ( tape  archive ) is used for single or multiple files backup and restore on/from  a tape or file
2. tar can not backup special character & block device files , shows as 0 byte files with first letter of permissions as b or c for block or character.
3. tar Works only on mounted file system, it can not access the files on unmounted file system.

Backing up all files in a directory including subdirectories to a  tape device (`/dev/rmt/0`) or a file.


### Example 1 :

            $tar    cvf    /dev/rmt/0   *

In the command above Options are  `c` -> **create** ; `v` -> **Verbose** ; `f`-> **file** or archive device   ; `*` -> all files and directories . Together the commands means create a tar file on /dev/rmt/0 from all file and directories s *in the current directory.*

### Example 2:

            $tar cvf /home/backup *

Create a tar  called backup in home directory , from all file and directories s in the current directory.

#### Viewing a tar backup on a tape or file

`t` option is used to see the table of content in a tar file.

            $tar    tvf    /dev/rmt/0  ## view files  backed up on a tape device.

            $tar tvf  /home/backup  ## view files  backed up inside the  backup

### Extracting tar backup from the tape

`x` option is used to extract the files from tar file.

extract /  restore files in to current directory.

            $tar xvf /dev/rmt/0       

extract / restore files in to current directory.

            $tar xvf /home/backup

Note : Restoration will go to present directory or original backup path depending on relative or absolute path names used for backup.

Some of useful tar options. 

- `-p, –preserve-permissions` -  Extract & keep the  file permissions (default for superuser)
- `-z`, `–gzip` - Filter the archive through gzip
- `-j`, `–bzip2` - Filter the archive through bzip2
- `-u`, `–update` Only append files newer than copy in archive
- `-r`, `–append` -  Append files to the end of an archive
- `–delete` - Delete from the archive (not on mag tapes!)
- `-d`, `–diff`, `–compare` - Find differences between archive and file system
- `–test-label` - Test the archive volume label and exit
- `-C`, `–directory=DIR` - Change to directory DIR

## find


for directories visibility use:

    find /mnt/user -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
 
and for files within a directory use:

    find /mnt/user -type f -exec chmod 700 {} \;

## Less 


      
                              SUMMARY OF LESS COMMANDS

            Commands marked with * may be preceded by a number, N.
            Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if N is given.
            A key preceded by a caret indicates the Ctrl key; thus ^K is ctrl-K.

`choose-client` [-t target-window] [template]
Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list. After a client is chosen, '%%' is replaced by the client pty(4) path in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used. This command works only from inside tmux.

`choose-session` [-t target-window] [template]

When one is chosen, '%%' is replaced by the session name in template and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used. This command works only from inside tmux.

`choose-window` [-t target-window] [template]

This command works only from inside tmux.

`display-panes `[-t target-client]
(alias: displayp) Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client. See the display-panes-time, display-panes-colour, and display-panes-active-colour session options. While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be selected with the '0' to '9' keys.

`find-window` [-t target-window] match-string
(alias: findw) Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern match-string in window names, titles, and visible content (but not history). If only one window is matched, it'll be automatically selected, otherwise a choice list is shown. This command only works from inside tmux.

`join-pane` [-dhv] [
-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
(alias: `joinp`) Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the space. This can be used to reverse break-pane.

`kill-pane` [-a] [-t target-pane]
(alias: `killp`) Destroy the given pane. If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed. The -a option kills all but the pane given with -t.

`kill-window` [-t target-window]
(alias: `killw`) Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing it from any sessions to which it is linked.

`last-pane` [-t target-window]
(alias: `lastp`) Select the last (previously selected) pane.

`last-window` [-t target-session]
(alias: `last`) Select the last (previously selected) window. If no target-session is specified, select the last window of the current session.

`link-window `[-dk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
(alias: `linkw`) Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window. If dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the src-window is linked there. If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is killed, otherwise an error is generated. If -d is given, the newly linked window is not selected.

`list-panes` [-as] [-t target]
(alias: `lsp`) If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed. If -s is given, target is a session (or the current session). If neither is given, target is a window (or the current window).

`list-windows` [-a] [-t target-session]
(alias: `lsw`) If -a is given, list all windows on the server. Otherwise, list windows in the current session or in target-session.

`move-window` [-dk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
(alias: `movew`) This is similar to link-window, except the window at src-window is moved to dst-window.

`new-window` [-adkP] [-n window-name] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
(alias: `neww`) Create a new window. With -a, the new window is inserted at the next index up from the specified target-window, moving windows up if necessary, otherwise target-window is the new window location.

If -d is given, the session does not make the new window the current window. target-window represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error is shown, unless the -k flag is used, in which case it is destroyed. shell-command is the command to execute. If shell-command is not specified, the value of the default-command option is used.

When the shell command completes, the window closes. See the remain-on-exit option to change this behaviour.

The TERM environment variable must be set to ''screen'' for all programs running inside tmux. New windows will automatically have ''TERM=screen'' added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.

The -P option prints the location of the new window after it has been created.

`next-layout` [-t target-window]
(alias: `nextl`) Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

`next-window` [-a] [-t target-session]
(alias: `next`) Move to the next window in the session. If -a is used, move to the next window with a bell, activity or content alert.

`pipe-pane` [-o] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
(alias: `pipep`) Pipe any output sent by the program in target-pane to a shell command. A pane may only be piped to one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed before shell-command is executed. The shell-command string may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left option. If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

The -o option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

`bind-key` C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat >>~/output.#I-#P' 

      `previous-layout `[-t target-window]

(alias: `prevl`) Move to the previous layout in the session.

`previous-window` [-a] [-t target-session]
(alias: `prev`) Move to the previous window in the session. With -a, move to the previous window with a bell, activity or content alert.

`rename-window` [-t target-window] new-name
(alias: `renamew`) Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if specified, to new-name.

`resize-pane` [-DLRU] [-t target-pane] [adjustment]
(alias: `resizep`) Resize a pane, upward with -U (the default), downward with -D, to the left with -L and to the right with -R. The adjustment is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).

`respawn-pane` [-k] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
(alias: `respawnp`) Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not given, the command used when the pane was created is executed. The pane must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.

`respawn-window` [-k] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
(alias: `respawnw`) Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not given, the command used when the window was created is executed. The window must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.

`rotate-window` [-DU] [-t target-window]
(alias: `rotatew`) Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically lower) with -U or downward (numerically higher).

`select-layout` [-np] [-t target-window] [layout-name]
(alias: `selectl`) Choose a specific layout for a window. If layout-name is not given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied. -n and -p are equivalent to the next-layout and previous-layout commands.

`select-pane` [-lDLRU] [-t target-pane]
(alias: `selectp`) Make pane target-pane the active pane in window target-window. If one of -D, -L, -R, or -U is used, respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used. -l is the same as using the last-pane command.

`select-window` [-lnp] [-t target-window]
(alias: `selectw`) Select the window at target-window. -l, -n and -p are equivalent to the last-window, next-window and previous-window commands.

`split-window` [-dhvP] [
-l size | -p percentage] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
(alias: `splitw`) Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a horizontal split and -v a vertical split; if neither is specified, -v is assumed. The -l and -p options specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage, respectively. All other options have the same meaning as for the new-window command.

`swap-pane` [-dDU] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
(alias: `swapp`) Swap two panes. If -U is used and no source pane is specified with -s, dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); -D swaps with the next pane (after it numerically). -d instructs tmux not to change the active pane.

`swap-window` [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
(alias: `swapw`) This is similar to link-window, except the source and destination windows are swapped. It is an error if no window exists at src-window.

`unlink-window`[-k] [-t target-window]
(alias: `unlinkw`) Unlink target-window. Unless -k is given, a window may be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may not be linked to no sessions; if -k is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed. 

### Useful Programs

#### SysStat (Sar)

[sar examples](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/03/sar-examples/)



sar collects and displays ALL system activities statistics.
sadc stands for “system activity data collector”. This is the sar backend tool that does the data collection.
sa1 stores system activities in binary data file. sa1 depends on sadc for this purpose. sa1 runs from cron.
sa2 creates daily summary of the collected statistics. sa2 runs from cron.
sadf can generate sar report in CSV, XML, and various other formats. Use this to integrate sar data with other tools.
iostat generates CPU, I/O statistics
mpstat displays CPU statistics.
pidstat reports statistics based on the process id (PID)
nfsiostat displays NFS I/O statistics.
cifsiostat generates CIFS statistics.

### Dos2Unix

`sudo apt install dos2unix`

This is supposed to be a program for converting paths.  Unknown more at this time.

## Bash

[Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)

[Pipelines](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Pipelines)

### Bash Setup


#### PATH

Path variables are in the home directory named

- `.bash_profile`
- `.profile`
- `.bashrc`

To see it you have to show hidden files - `ls -a`

#### Startup

`sudo apt install screenfetch`

The above has a bug.

Use:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch/master/screenfetch-dev
chmod +x screenfetch-dev
./screenfetch-dev
#if the old one (above) was installed-
sudo rm /usr/bin/screenfetch
remname ./screenfetch-dev screenfetch
sudo mv screenfetch /user/bin
```

sudo apt install toilet
sudo apt install figlet


### Usage

#### Run a bash shell script

A shell script is a text file containing one or more commands.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#My example bash script
echo "Hello World"
```

The first line contains a **shebang** `#!` followed by the path to the shell, in this case bash - this acts as an interpreter directive and ensures that the script is executed under the correct shell.

The "`#`" character indicates a comment, so the shebang line is ignored by bash when running the script.

Next you need to make the script executable with chmod

`$ chmod u+x my_script1.sh`

You can now run the script by prefixing it with ./

`$ ./my_script1.sh`

Naming the file with an .sh extension is not required, but you may find it a helpful reminder that the file is a shell script.

If you will be writing a few shell scripts then it's worth creating a folder, perhaps called "scripts" and adding that to the system path:

```bash
$ mkdir -p $HOME/scripts
>
$ export PATH="$PATH:~/scripts"
>
```

Even better is to edit your .bash_profile file to include export PATH="\$PATH:~/scripts" that will keep the "scripts" folder in your path every time you log in.

With the script saved in the folder, you can now run it with just:

`$ my_script1.sh`

If this returns an error like #: bad interpreter: No such file or directory that is typically an indication that the File encoding or line endings are wrong, use an editor like VI or just make sure the text is plain ASCII/Unicode and the line endings are classic UNIX LF (not Windows CR/LF or Mac CR)

Passing parameters to a shell script:

```bash
$ cat myscript2.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Welcome' $0 'says' $1 $2

$ chmod a+x myscript2.sh
$ myscript2.sh Hello world
Welcome myscript2.sh says Hello world
```

Running scripts from the system path
A shell script is a text file containing shell commands. When such a file is used as the first non-option argument when invoking Bash, and neither the \`-c' nor \`-s' option is supplied, Bash reads and executes commands from the file, then exits. This mode of operation creates a non-interactive shell.

A shell script can be made executable by using the chmod command to turn on the execute bit. When Bash finds such a file while searching the \$PATH for a command, it spawns a subshell to execute it.

In other words, executing `filename arguments` is equivalent to executing `bash filename arguments` if filename is an executable shell script. This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to interpret the script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent are retained by the child.

Most versions of Unix make this a part of the operating system's command execution mechanism. If the first line of a script begins with the two characters `#!', the remainder of the line specifies an interpreter for the program. Thus, you can specify Bash, awk, Perl, or some other interpreter and write the rest of the script file in that language.

The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the script file, followed by the name of the script file, followed by the rest of the arguments. Bash will perform this action on operating systems that do not handle it themselves. Note that some older versions of Unix limit the interpreter name and argument to a maximum of 32 characters.

Bash scripts often begin with #! /bin/bash (assuming that Bash has been installed in /bin ), since this ensures that Bash will be used to interpret the script, even if it is executed under another shell.

When Bash runs a shell script, it sets the special parameter \$0 to the name of the file, rather than the name of the shell, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments, if any are given. If no additional arguments are supplied, the positional parameters are unset.

Adding the following two set options to your scripts can be useful to catch undefined variables ("") and to exit if a command fails:

`#!/bin/bash set -o nounset set -o errexit`

Errors:

`/bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: no such file or directory`
This usually means the file has been edited and has Windows `<CR-LF>` instead of unix `<LF>` line endings

### Quotes and Strings

#### Escape

A non-quoted backslash `\` is the Bash escape character. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of newline. If a `\newline` pair appears, and the backslash itself is not quoted, the \newline is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

#### Single Quotes

Enclosing characters in single quotes **(`'`) preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.** A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash

#### Double Quotes

Enclosing characters in double quotes (`"`) **preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of `$`, `` ` ``(backtick), `\`, and, when history expansion is enabled, `!`.**

 When the shell is in POSIX mode, the `!` has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion is enabled. The characters `$` and `` ` `` retain their special meaning within double quotes (see Shell Expansions). The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: `$`, `` ` ``, `"`, `\`, or newline. Within double quotes, backslashes that are followed by one of these characters are removed. Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified.

A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an `!` appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the `!` is not removed.

The special parameters `*` and `@` have special meaning when in double quotes

#### ANSI C Quoting

Words of the form $'string' are treated specially. The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard. Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:

- `\a` - alert (bell)
- `\b`- backspace
- `\e`, `\E` - an escape character (not ANSI C)
- `\f` - form feed
- `\n` - newline
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\t` - horizontal tab
- `\v` - vertical tab
- `\\` - backslash
- `\'` - single quote
- `\"` - double quote
- `\?` - question mark
- `\nnn` - the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three octal digits)
- `\xHH` - the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)
- `\uHHHH` - the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)
- `\UHHHHHHHH` - the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)
- `\cx` - a control-x character

## Terminal Color Output

!!! Warning ZSH Specific-
  On even more testing, its revieled from `type print` that its a shell built-in.  Running the same command on bash- doesnt work.

  This is onbe of the ZSH Built in features.  
  
  
[ZSH Features](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html#SEC_Contents)



[There are others](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html)



This will print out the terminals colors:

```sh
for i in {0..255}; do print -Pn "%K{$i}  %k%F{$i}${(l:3::0:)i}%f " ${${(M)$((i%6)):#3}:+$'\n'}; done
```

I picked this appart, and the critical bits are  the `-P` flag, and the `%` flags.  A capital seems to set it

- %K{value} sets the BACKGROUND color
- %k - unsets it
  - %k{value}  just prints {value} (its entirely ignored.)
- %F{value} sets the foreground color.
- %f unsets it.


This is the relevant seciton

13.2.5 Visual effects

%B (%b)

    Start (stop) boldface mode.
%E

    Clear to end of line.
%U (%u)

    Start (stop) underline mode.
%S (%s)

    Start (stop) standout mode.
%F (%f)

    Start (stop) using a different foreground colour, if supported by the terminal. The colour may be specified two ways: either as a numeric argument, as normal, or by a sequence in braces following the %F, for example %F{red}. In the latter case the values allowed are as described for the fg zle_highlight attribute; Character Highlighting. This means that numeric colours are allowed in the second format also.
%K (%k)

    Start (stop) using a different bacKground colour. The syntax is identical to that for %F and %f.
%{...%}

    Include a string as a literal escape sequence. The string within the braces should not change the cursor position. Brace pairs can nest.

    A positive numeric argument between the % and the { is treated as described for %G below.
%G

    Within a %{...%} sequence, include a ‘glitch’: that is, assume that a single character width will be output. This is useful when outputting characters that otherwise cannot be correctly handled by the shell, such as the alternate character set on some terminals. The characters in question can be included within a %{...%} sequence together with the appropriate number of %G sequences to indicate the correct width. An integer between the ‘%’ and ‘G’ indicates a character width other than one. Hence %{seq%2G%} outputs seq and assumes it takes up the width of two standard characters.

    Multiple uses of %G accumulate in the obvious fashion; the position of the %G is unimportant. Negative integers are not handled.

    Note that when prompt truncation is in use it is advisable to divide up output into single characters within each %{...%} group so that the correct truncation point can be found.

### Bash Syntax

#### Arguments

**Shell parameters** can be a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed below. For the shell's purposes, a variable is a parameter denoted by a name.

A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value. The null string is a valid value. Once a variable is set, it can be unset only by using the `unset` builtin command.

A variable can be assigned to by a statement of the form `name=[value]`

If value is not given, the variable is assigned the null string (_declaration_). All values undergo _tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal_ (detailed below). If the variable has its _integer attribute_ set, then value is subject to arithmetic expansion even if the `$((...))` expansion is not used. Word splitting is not performed, with the exception of `"$@"` as explained below. Filename expansion is not performed.

**Positional Parameters**
A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0. Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and can be reassigned using the `set` builtin command. Positional parameter **N** can be referenced as `${N}`, or as `$N`(when N consists of a single When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces.

Positional parameters can not be assigned to with assignment statements. The `set` and `shift` builtins are used to set and unset them. The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed.

**Special Parameters**
The shell treats several parameters specially. These parameters can only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.

- `*` Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the **IFS** special variable. That is, `"$*"` is equivalent to `"$1c$2c..."`, where `c` is the first character of the value of the **IFS** variable. If **IFS** is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If **IFS** is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.

- `@` Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word. That is, `"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1" "$2" ...`. When there are no positional parameters, `"$@"` and `$@` expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).

- `#` Expands to the **number of positional parameters** in decimal.

- `?` Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.

- **`-`(A hyphen.)** Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the set builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the `-i' option).

- `$` Expands to the **process ID of the shell.** In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the invoking shell, not the subshell.

- `!` Expands to the **process ID of the job most recently placed into the background,** whether executed as an asynchronous command or using bg

- `0` Expands to the **name of the shell or shell script.** This is set at shell initialization. If Bash is invoked with a file of commands, $0 is set to the name of that file. If Bash is started with the `-c' option, then$0 is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present. Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke Bash, as given by argument zero.

- `_` **(An underscore.)** At shell startup, set to the **absolute filename of the shell or shell script being executed** as passed in the argument list. Subsequently, expands to the last argument to the previous command, after expansion. Also set to the full pathname of each command executed and placed in the environment exported to that command. When checking mail, this parameter holds the name of the mail file.

#### Arrays

Bash provides one-dimensional array variables. Any variable can be used as an array; the declare builtin will explicitly declare an array. There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously. Arrays are zero-based.

An array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax

`name[subscript]=value`
The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number greater than or equal to zero. To explicitly declare an array, use

`declare -a name`

**The syntax**

`declare -a name[subscript]` is also accepted; the subscript is ignored. Attributes can be specified for an array variable using the declare and readonly builtins. Each attribute applies to all members of an array.

Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form: `name=(value1 ... valuen)`, where each value is of the form `[[subscript]=]string`. If the optional subscript is supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the statement plus one. Indexing starts at zero.

This syntax is also accepted by the declare builtin. Individual array elements can be assigned to using the `name[subscript]=value` syntax introduced above.

Any element of an array can be referenced using `\${name[subscript]}`.

The braces are required to avoid conflicts with the shell's filename expansion operators.

If the subscript is `@` or `_`, the word expands to all members of the array name. These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes. If the word is double-quoted, \${name[_]} expands to a single word with the value of each array member separated by the first character of the IFS variable, and ${name[@]} expands each element of name to a separate word.
When there are no array members, `${name[@]}` expands to nothing. This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters `@` and`_`. `${#name[subscript]}` expands to the length of${name[subscript]}. If subscript is `@' or`_', the expansion is the number of elements in the array.

Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing element zero.

The `unset` builtin is used to destroy arrays. unset `name[subscript]` destroys the array element at index subscript.

`unset name`, where `name` is an array, removes the entire array. A subscript of `*` or `@` also removes the entire array.

The `declare`, `local`, and `readonly` builtins each accept a `-a` option to specify an array.

The contents of the directory stack are also visible as the value of the `DIRSTACK` shell variable.


### Bash Snippets

#### Generate a menu

```sh
select fname in *;
do
	echo you picked $fname \($REPLY\)
	break;
done
```

I think there needs to be a semi-colon after line 3- otherwise it keeps looping?

#### Rename a file

There is no rename command...?  rename is a program in Apt that is vastly more complicated.

`mv file1.ext file2.ext`

#### Alias syntax

`alias mycommand !:1 !:2`

Then `!:1` references the arguments from the input.  Add to profile any aliases.

#### yes

[Source of Yes Info](https://linuxhint.com/bash_yes_command/)

Typing `yes` causes 'y' to be printed over and over.

This is intentional.  Any word after `yes` is repeated infinite time.  `yes test` prints "test" over and over.

You can use `yes` command to prevent from overwriting the existing file or forcefully overwrite the existing file. In the following commands, the first command is used to prevent the overwrite and the second command is used to overwrite the file without any permission.

```bash
cat hello.txt
cat sample.txt
cp -i sample.txt hello.txt
yes n | cp -i sample.txt hello.txt #prevent overwiting by saying no to each
yes | cp -i sample.txt hello.txt #force overwrite by saying yes to each.
```

You can use `yes` command to run any script multiple times in the command line. In this example, `yes` command is used to run while loop repeatedly ten times. Here, `yes` command will continuously send the numeric value from 1 to 10 to the loop and the loop will print the values in regular interval of one second.


```Bash
$ yes "$(seq 1 10)" | while read n; do  echo $n; sleep 1; done
```

```Bash
#Example 5
#!/bin/bash
#Read the value passed from yes command
read string

#check the string value is empty or not
if [ "$string" == "" ]; then

echo "Empty value is passed by yes command"
else
newstr="The value passed by yes command is $string"
echo $newstr
fi

#Which is read and run by:
$ yes "" | bash yes_script.sh
>>>Empty value is passed by yes command
#or
$yes testing | bash yes_script.sh
>>>The value passed by yes is testing
```
Or write a string over and over into a file, for "testing" or something:

`yes 'Add this line for testing' | head -50 > testfile`

## ZSH 

Need to determine from the above which are Unix /Linux and which are ZSH.

## Terminal Color Output

!!! Warning ZSH Specific-
  On even more testing, its revieled from `type print` that its a shell built-in.  Running the same command on bash- doesnt work.

  This is onbe of the ZSH Built in features.  
  
  
[ZSH Features](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html#SEC_Contents)



[There are others](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html)



This will print out the terminals colors:

```sh
for i in {0..255}; do print -Pn "%K{$i}  %k%F{$i}${(l:3::0:)i}%f " ${${(M)$((i%6)):#3}:+$'\n'}; done
```

I picked this appart, and the critical bits are  the `-P` flag, and the `%` flags.  A capital seems to set it

- %K{value} sets the BACKGROUND color
- %k - unsets it
  - %k{value}  just prints {value} (its entirely ignored.)
- %F{value} sets the foreground color.
- %f unsets it.




alias [ {+|-}gmrsL ] [ name[=value] ... ]
For each name with a corresponding value, define an alias with that value.  [More](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Shell-Grammar.html#Aliasing)



autoload [ {+|-}RTUXdkmrtWz ] [ -w ] [ name ... ]
See the section ‘Autoloading Functions’ in [Functions](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Functions)for full details. The fpath parameter will be searched to find the function definition when the function is first referenced.

`bg [ job ... ] job ... &` - Put each specified job in the background, or the current job if none is specified.

bindkey  - see [ZLE](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Builtins)



`break [ n ]` - Exit from an enclosing for, while, until, select or repeat loop. If an arithmetic expression n is specified, then break n levels instead of just one.

`builtin name [ args ... ]` Executes the builtin name, with the given args.

`bye` - Same as exit.

`cap` - See The [zsh/cap Module](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fcap-Module)

. - The zsh/cap module is used for manipulating POSIX.1e (POSIX.6) capability sets. If the operating system does not support this interface, the builtins defined by this module will do nothing. The builtins in this module are:

  - `cap [ capabilities ]` - Change the shell’s process capability sets to the specified capabilities, otherwise display the shell’s current capabilities.

  - `getcap filename ...` - This is a built-in implementation of the POSIX standard utility. It displays the capability sets on each specified filename.

  - `setcap capabilities filename ...` This is a built-in implementation of the POSIX standard utility. It sets the capability sets on each specified filename to the specified capabilities.

    cd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ]
    cd [ -qsLP ] old new
    cd [ -qsLP ] {+|-}n

Change the current directory. In the first form, change the current directory to arg, or to the value of $HOME if arg is not specified. If arg is ‘-’, change to the previous directory.

`chdir`

Same as `cd`.

`clone`

See [The zsh/clone Module](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fclone-Module).

`command` [ `-pvV` ] *simple command*

The simple command argument is taken as an external command instead of a function or builtin and is executed. If the `POSIX_BUILTINS` option is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties of them are suppressed. The `-p` flag causes a default path to be searched instead of that in `$path`. With the `-v` flag, `command` is similar to `whence` and with `-V`, it is equivalent to `whence -v`.

See [The zsh/computil Module](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fcomputil-Module).

`continue` [ *n* ]

Resume the next iteration of the enclosing `for`, `while`, `until`, `select` or `repeat` loop. If an arithmetic expression *n* is specified, break out of *n*-1 loops and resume at the *n*th enclosing loop.

`declare`

Same as `typeset`.

`dirs` [ `-c` ] [ *arg* ... ]

`dirs` [ `-lpv` ] - With no arguments, print the contents of the directory stack. Directories are added to this stack with the `pushd` command, and removed with the `cd` or `popd` commands. If arguments are specified, load them onto the directory stack, replacing anything that was there, and push the current directory onto the stack.
    - `-c` clear the directory stack.
    - `-l`-  print directory names in full instead of using of using `~` expressions ([Filename Expansion](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion)).
    - `-p` - print directory entries one per line.
    - `-v` - number the directories in the stack when printing.

`disable` [ `-afmprs` ] *name* ...

Temporarily disable the *name*d hash table elements or patterns. The default is to disable builtin commands.

  - see this page for more-  There are many options.

- 
  `disown` [ *job* ... ]
  *job* ... `&|`
  *job* ... `&!`

  Remove the specified *job*s from the job table; the shell will no longer report their status, and will not complain if you try to exit an interactive shell with them running or stopped. If no *job* is specified, disown the current job.

`echo` [ `-neE` ] [ *arg* ... ] -  Write each *arg* on the standard output, with a space separating each one. If the `-n` flag is not present, print a newline at the end. `echo` recognizes the following escape sequences:

   -  `\a` - bell character

  -  `\b` - backspace

  -  `\c` - suppress subsequent characters and final newline

  -  `\e` - escape

  -  `\f` - form feed

  -  `\n` - linefeed (newline)

  -  `\r` - carriage return

  -  `\t` - horizontal tab

  -  `\v` - vertical tab

  -  `\\` - backslash

  -  `\0`*NNN* - character code in octal

  -  `\x`*NN* - character code in hexadecimal

  -  `\u`*NNNN* - unicode character code in hexadecimal

  -  `\U`*NNNNNNNN* - unicode character code in hexadecimal

The `-E` flag, or the `BSD_ECHO` option, can be used to disable these escape sequences. In the latter case, `-e` flag can be used to enable them.

  -  `echotc` - See [The zsh/termcap Module](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002ftermcap-Module).

  -  `echoti` - See [The zsh/terminfo Module](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fterminfo-Module).

  -  `emulate` [ `-lLR` ] [ {`zsh`|`sh`|`ksh`|`csh`} [ *flags* ... ] ] 
    - Without any argument print current emulation mode.
    - With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the specified shell as much as possible. *csh* will never be fully emulated

`g` [ *job* ... ]
*job* ...

  Bring each specified *job* in turn to the foreground. If no *job* is specified, resume the current job.

`float` [ {`+`|`-`}`Hghlprtux` ] [ {`+`|`-`}`EFLRZ` [ *n* ] ] [ *name*[`=`*value*] ... ]

Equivalent to `typeset -E`, except that options irrelevant to floating point numbers are not permitted.

`getln` [ `-AclneE` ] *name* ...

Read the top value from the buffer stack and put it in the shell parameter *name*. Equivalent to `read -zr`.

`getopts` *optstring* *name* [ *arg* ... ]

Checks the *arg*s for legal options. If the *arg*s are omitted, use the positional parameters. A valid option argument begins with a '`+`' or a '`-`'. An argument not beginning with a '`+`' or a '`-`', or the argument '`-``-`', ends the options. Note that a single '`-`' is not considered a valid option argument. *optstring* contains the letters that `getopts` recognizes. If a letter is followed by a '`:`', that option requires an argument. The options can be separated from the argument by blanks.

`hash` [ `-Ldfmrv` ] [ *name*[`=`*value*] ] ...

`hash` can be used to directly modify the contents of the command hash table, and the named directory hash table. Normally one would modify these tables by modifying one's `PATH` (for the command hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters (for the named directory hash table).

`jobs` [ `-dlprs` ] [ *job* ... ]

`jobs -Z` *string*

Lists information about each given job, or all jobs if *job* is omitted. The `-l` flag lists process IDs, and the `-p` flag lists process groups. If the `-r` flag is specified only running jobs will be listed and if the `-s` flag is given only stopped jobs are shown. If the `-d` flag is given, the directory from which the job was started (which may not be the current directory of the job) will also be shown.


`kill` [ `-s` *signal_name* | `-n` *signal_number* | `-`*sig* ] *job* ...

`kill` `-l` [ *sig* ... ]

Sends either `SIGTERM` or the specified signal to the given jobs or processes. Signals are given by number or by names, with or without the '`SIG`' prefix. If the signal being sent is not '`KILL`' or '`CONT`', then the job will be sent a '`CONT`' signal if it is stopped. The argument *job* can be the process ID of a job not in the job list. In the second form, `kill -l`, if *sig* is not specified the signal names are listed.
`let` *arg* ...

Evaluate each *arg* as an arithmetic expression. See [Arithmetic Evaluation](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Arithmetic-Evaluation.html#Arithmetic-Evaluation) for a description of arithmetic expressions. The exit status is 0 if the value of the last expression is nonzero, 1 if it is zero, and 2 if an error occurred.

`limit` [ `-hs` ] [ *resource* [ *limit* ] ] ...

Set or display resource limits. Unless the `-s` flag is given, the limit applies only the children of the shell. If `-s` is given w

!!!Note Too many of these, will leave it here

After including Print:

### Print

`print `[ `-abcDilmnNoOpPrsSz` ] [ `-u` *n* ] [ `-f` *format* ] [ `-C` *cols* ]

[ `-v` *name* ] [ `-xX` *tabstop* ] [ `-R` [ `-en` ]] [ *arg* ... ]

With the '`-f`' option the arguments are printed as described by `printf`. With no flags or with the flag '`-`', the arguments are printed on the standard output as described by `echo`, with the following differences: the escape sequence '`\M-`*x*' (or '`\M`*x*') metafies the character *x* (sets the highest bit), '`\C-`*x*' (or '`\C`*x*') produces a control character ('`\C-@`' and '`\C-?`' give the characters NULL and delete), a character code in octal is represented by '`\`*NNN*' (instead of '`\0`*NNN*'), and '`\E`' is a synonym for '`\e`'. Finally, if not in an escape sequence, '`\`' escapes the following character and is not printed.

  -  `-a` - Print arguments with the column incrementing first. Only useful with the `-c` and `-C` options.

  -  `-b` - Recognize all the escape sequences defined for the `bindkey` command, see [Zle Builtins](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Builtins).

  -  `-c` - Print the arguments in columns. Unless `-a` is also given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing first.

  -  `-C` *cols* - Print the arguments in *cols* columns. Unless `-a` is also given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing first.

  -  `-D` - Treat the arguments as paths, replacing directory prefixes with `~` expressions corresponding to directory names, as appropriate.

  -  `-i` - If given together with `-o` or `-O`, sorting is performed case-independently.

  -  `-l` - Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of spaces. Note: if the list of arguments is empty, `print -l` will still output one empty line. To print a possibly-empty list of arguments one per line, use `print -C1`, as in '`print -rC1 -- "$list[@]"`'.

  -  `-m` - Take the first argument as a pattern (should be quoted), and remove it from the argument list together with subsequent arguments that do not match this pattern.

  -  `-n` - Do not add a newline to the output.

  -  `-N` - Print the arguments separated and terminated by nulls. Again, `print -rNC1 -- "$list[@]"` is a canonical way to print an arbitrary list as null-delimited records.

  -  `-o` - Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.

  -  `-O` - Print the arguments sorted in descending order.

  -  `-p` - Print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.

  -  `-P` - Perform prompt expansion (see [Prompt Expansion](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Prompt-Expansion)). In combination with '`-f`', prompt escape sequences are parsed only within interpolated arguments, not within the format string.

  -  `-r` - Ignore the escape conventions of `echo`.

  -  `-R` - Emulate the BSD `echo` command, which does not process escape sequences unless the `-e` flag is given. The `-n` flag suppresses the trailing newline. Only the `-e` and `-n` flags are recognized after `-R`; all other arguments and options are printed.

  -  `-s` - Place the results in the history list instead of on the standard output. Each argument to the `print` command is treated as a single word in the history, regardless of its content.

  -  `-S` - Place the results in the history list instead of on the standard output. In this case only a single argument is allowed; it will be split into words as if it were a full shell command line. The effect is similar to reading the line from a history file with the `HIST_LEX_WORDS` option active.

  -  `-u` *n* - Print the arguments to file descriptor *n*.

  -  `-v` *name* - Store the printed arguments as the value of the parameter *name*.

  -  `-x` *tab-stop* - Expand leading tabs on each line of output in the printed string assuming a tab stop every *tab-stop* characters. This is appropriate for formatting code that may be indented with tabs. Note that leading tabs of any argument to print, not just the first, are expanded, even if `print` is using spaces to separate arguments (the column count is maintained across arguments but may be incorrect on output owing to previous unexpanded tabs).

The start of the output of each print command is assumed to be aligned with a tab stop. Widths of multibyte characters are handled if the option `MULTIBYTE` is in effect. This option is ignored if other formatting options are in effect, namely column alignment or `printf` style, or if output is to a special location such as shell history or the command line editor.

  -  `-X` *tab-stop* - This is similar to `-x`, except that all tabs in the printed string are expanded. This is appropriate if tabs in the arguments are being used to produce a table format.

  -  `-z` - Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack, separated by spaces.

If any of '`-m`', '`-o`' or '`-O`' are used in combination with '`-f`' and there are no arguments (after the removal process in the case of '`-m`') then nothing is printed.

`printf` [ `-v` *name* ] *format* [ *arg* ... ]

Print the arguments according to the format specification. Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escape sequences as for `echo` are recognised in the format. All C conversion specifications ending in one of `csdiouxXeEfgGn` are handled. In addition to this, '`%b`' can be used instead of '`%s`' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and '`%q`' can be used to quote the argument in such a way that allows it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character, the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See [Arithmetic Evaluation](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Arithmetic-Evaluation.html#Arithmetic-Evaluation) for a description of arithmetic expressions. With '`%n`', the corresponding argument is taken as an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.

Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order but they can explicitly specify the *n*th argument is to be used by replacing '`%`' by '`%`*n*`$`' and '`*`' by '`*`*n*`$`'. It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style with the normal style and the handling of such mixed styles may be subject to future change.

If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused until all arguments have been consumed. With the `print` builtin, this can be suppressed by using the `-r` option. If more arguments are required by the format than have been specified, the behaviour is as if zero or an empty string had been specified as the argument.

The `-v` option causes the output to be stored as the value of the parameter *name*, instead of printed. If *name* is an array and the format string is reused when consuming arguments then one array element will be used for each use of the format string.


### 'Prompt` expansion

[Source- Verbatim](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Prompt-Expansion)


* * * * *
#### 13.1 Expansion of Prompt Sequences
* * * * *

Prompt sequences undergo a special form of expansion. This type of expansion is also available using the `-P` option to the `print` builtin.

If the `PROMPT_SUBST` option is set, the prompt string is first subjected to *parameter expansion*, *command substitution* and *arithmetic expansion*. See [Expansion](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Expansion).

Certain escape sequences may be recognised in the prompt string.

If the `PROMPT_BANG` option is set, a '`!`' in the prompt is replaced by the current history event number. A literal '`!`' may then be represented as '`!!`'.

If the `PROMPT_PERCENT` option is set, certain escape sequences that start with '`%`' are expanded. Many escapes are followed by a single character, although some of these take an optional integer argument that should appear between the '`%`' and the next character of the sequence. More complicated escape sequences are available to provide conditional expansion.

* * * * *

#### 13.2 Simple Prompt Escapes

* * * * *

##### 13.2.1 Special characters

`%%` -> An '`%`'.

`%)` -> A '`)`'.

* * * * *

##### 13.2.2 Login information

  -  `%l` - The line (tty) the user is logged in on, without '`/dev/`' prefix. If the name starts with '`/dev/tty`', that prefix is stripped.

  -  `%M` - The full machine hostname.

  -  `%m` - The hostname up to the first '`.`'. An integer may follow the '`%`' to specify how many components of the hostname are desired. With a negative integer, trailing components of the hostname are shown.

  -  `%n` - `$USERNAME`.

  -  `%y` - The line (tty) the user is logged in on, without '`/dev/`' prefix. This does not treat '`/dev/tty`' names specially.

* * * * *
##### 13.2.3 Shell state

  -  `%#` - A '`#`' if the shell is running with privileges, a '`%`' if not. Equivalent to '`%(!.#.%%)`'. The definition of 'privileged', for these purposes, is that either the effective user ID is zero, or, if POSIX.1e capabilities are supported, that at least one capability is raised in either the Effective or Inheritable capability vectors.

  -  `%?` - The return status of the last command executed just before the prompt.

  -  `%_` - The status of the parser, i.e. the shell constructs (like '`if`' and '`for`') that have been started on the command line. If given an integer number that many strings will be printed; zero or negative or no integer means print as many as there are. This is most useful in prompts `PS2` for continuation lines and `PS4` for debugging with the `XTRACE` option; in the latter case it will also work non-interactively.

  -  `%^` - The status of the parser in reverse. This is the same as '`%_`' other than the order of strings. It is often used in `RPS2`.

  -  `%d` or `%/` - Current working directory. If an integer follows the '`%`', it specifies a number of trailing components of the current working directory to show; zero means the whole path. A negative integer specifies leading components, i.e. `%-1d` specifies the first component.

        ❯ print -P %d
          /mnt/o/OneDrive/Programming/C++/CLionProj/OOPCPP/MiniProj1.3/lib/TermOx
      ❯ print -P %3d
          MiniProj1.3/lib/TermOx
      ❯ print -P %-3d
          /mnt/o/OneDrive

  -  `%~` - As `%d` and `%/`, but if the current working directory starts with `$HOME`, that part is replaced by a '`~`'. Furthermore, if it has a named directory as its prefix, that part is replaced by a '`~`' followed by the name of the directory, but only if the result is shorter than the full path; [Filename Expansion](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion).

  -  `%e` - Evaluation depth of the current sourced file, shell function, or `eval`. This is incremented or decremented every time the value of `%N` is set or reverted to a previous value, respectively. This is most useful for debugging as part of `$PS4`.

  -  `%h` or `%!` - Current history event number.

  -  `%i` - The line number currently being executed in the script, sourced file, or shell function given by `%N`. This is most useful for debugging as part of `$PS4`.

  -  `%I` - The line number currently being executed in the file `%x`. This is similar to `%i`, but the line number is always a line number in the file where the code was defined, even if the code is a shell function.

  -  `%j` - The number of jobs.

  -  `%L` - The current value of `$SHLVL`.

  -  `%N` - The name of the script, sourced file, or shell function that zsh is currently executing, whichever was started most recently. If there is none, this is equivalent to the parameter `$0`. An integer may follow the '`%`' to specify a number of trailing path components to show; zero means the full path. A negative integer specifies leading components.

  -  `%x` - The name of the file containing the source code currently being executed. This behaves as `%N` except that function and eval command names are not shown, instead the file where they were defined.

`%c` |  `%.`  |  `%C`  - Trailing component of the current working directory. An integer may follow the '`%`' to get more than one component. Unless '`%C`' is used, tilde contraction is performed first. These are deprecated as `%c` and `%C` are equivalent to `%1~` and `%1/`, respectively, while explicit positive integers have the same effect as for the latter two sequences.

* * * * *
##### 13.2.4 Date and time

  -  `%D` - The date in *yy*`-`*mm*`-`*dd* format.

  -  `%T` - Current time of day, in 24-hour format.

  -  `%t` | `%@` - Current time of day, in 12-hour, am/pm format.

  -  `%*` - Current time of day in 24-hour format, with seconds.

  -  `%w` - The date in *day*`-`*dd* format.

  -  `%W` - The date in *mm*`/`*dd*`/`*yy* format.

  -  `%D{`*string*`}` - *string* is formatted using the `strftime` function. See man page strftime(3) for more details. Various zsh extensions provide numbers with no leading zero or space if the number is a single digit:

  -  `%f` - a day of the month

  -  `%K` - the hour of the day on the 24-hour clock

  -  `%L` - the hour of the day on the 12-hour clock

In addition, if the system supports the POSIX `gettimeofday` system call, `%.` provides decimal fractions of a second since the epoch with leading zeroes. By default three decimal places are provided, but a number of digits up to 9 may be given following the `%`; hence `%6.` outputs microseconds, and `%9.` outputs nanoseconds. (The latter requires a nanosecond-precision `clock_gettime`; systems lacking this will return a value multiplied by the appropriate power of 10.) A typical example of this is the format '`%D{%H:%M:%S.%.}`'.

The GNU extension `%N` is handled as a synonym for `%9.`.

Additionally, the GNU extension that a '`-`' between the `%` and the format character causes a leading zero or space to be stripped is handled directly by the shell for the format characters `d`, `f`, `H`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `M`, `S` and `y`; any other format characters are provided to the system's strftime(3) with any leading '`-`' present, so the handling is system dependent. Further GNU (or other) extensions are also passed to strftime(3) and may work if the system supports them.

* * * * *

##### 13.2.5 Visual effects

  -  `%B` (`%b`) - Start (stop) boldface mode.

  -  `%E` - Clear to end of line.

  -  `%U` (`%u`) - Start (stop) underline mode.

  -  `%S` (`%s`) - Start (stop) standout mode.

  -  `%F` (`%f`) - Start (stop) using a different foreground colour, if supported by the terminal. The colour may be specified two ways: either as a numeric argument, as normal, or by a sequence in braces following the `%F`, for example `%F{red}`. In the latter case the values allowed are as described for the `fg` `zle_highlight` attribute; [Character Highlighting](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Character-Highlighting). This means that numeric colours are allowed in the second format also.

  -  `%K` (`%k`) - Start (stop) using a different bacKground colour. The syntax is identical to that for `%F` and `%f`.

  -  `%{`...`%}` - Include a string as a literal escape sequence. The string within the braces should not change the cursor position. Brace pairs can nest.

    - A positive numeric argument between the `%` and the `{` is treated as described for `%G` below.

  -  `%G` - Within a `%{`...`%}` sequence, include a 'glitch': that is, assume that a single character width will be output. This is useful when outputting characters that otherwise cannot be correctly handled by the shell, such as the alternate character set on some terminals. The characters in question can be included within a `%{`...`%}` sequence together with the appropriate number of `%G` sequences to indicate the correct width. An integer between the '`%`' and '`G`' indicates a character width other than one. Hence `%{`*seq*`%2G%}` outputs *seq* and assumes it takes up the width of two standard characters.
    - Multiple uses of `%G` accumulate in the obvious fashion; the position of the `%G` is unimportant. Negative integers are not handled.
    - Note that when prompt truncation is in use it is advisable to divide up output into single characters within each `%{`...`%}` group so that the correct truncation point can be found.

* * * * *
#### 13.3 Conditional Substrings in Prompts
--------------------------------------

-  `%v` - The value of the first element of the `psvar` array parameter. Following the '`%`' with an integer gives that element of the array. Negative integers count from the end of the array.

-  `%(`*x*`.`*true-text*`.`*false-text*`)` - Specifies a ternary expression. The character following the *x* is arbitrary; the same character is used to separate the text for the 'true' result from that for the 'false' result. This separator may not appear in the *true-text*, except as part of a %-escape sequence. A '`)`' may appear in the *false-text* as '`%)`'. *true-text* and *false-text* may both contain arbitrarily-nested escape sequences, including further ternary expressions.

    - The left parenthesis may be preceded or followed by a positive integer *n*, which defaults to zero. A negative integer will be multiplied by -1, except as noted below for '`l`'. The test character *x* may be any of the following:

  -  `!` - True if the shell is running with privileges.

  -  `#` - True if the effective uid of the current process is *n*.

  -  `?` - True if the exit status of the last command was *n*.

  -  `_` - True if at least *n* shell constructs were started.
- `C` |  `/` - True if the current absolute path has at least *n* elements relative to the root directory, hence `/` is counted as 0 elements.
- `c`  | `.`  |   `~` - True if the current path, with prefix replacement, has at least *n* elements relative to the root directory, hence `/` is counted as 0 elements.
- `D` - True if the month is equal to *n* (January = 0).



-  `d` - True if the day of the month is equal to *n*.

-  `e` - True if the evaluation depth is at least *n*.

-  `g` - True if the effective gid of the current process is *n*.

-  `j` - True if the number of jobs is at least *n*.

-  `L` - True if the `SHLVL` parameter is at least *n*.

-  `l` - True if at least *n* characters have already been printed on the current line. When *n* is negative, true if at least `abs``(`*n*`)` characters remain before the opposite margin (thus the left margin for `RPROMPT`).

-  `S` - True if the `SECONDS` parameter is at least *n*.

-  `T` - True if the time in hours is equal to *n*.

-  `t` - True if the time in minutes is equal to *n*.

-  `v` - True if the array `psvar` has at least *n* elements.

-  `V` - True if element *n* of the array `psvar` is set and non-empty.

-  `w` - True if the day of the week is equal to *n* (Sunday = 0).

-  `%<`*string*`<`  |  `%>`*string*`>` | `%[`*xstring*`]` - Specifies truncation behaviour for the remainder of the prompt string. The third, deprecated, form is equivalent to '`%`*xstringx*', i.e. *x* may be '`<`' or '`>`'. The *string* will be displayed in place of the truncated portion of any string; note this does not undergo prompt expansion.

The numeric argument, which in the third form may appear immediately after the '`[`', specifies the maximum permitted length of the various strings that can be displayed in the prompt. In the first two forms, this numeric argument may be negative, in which case the truncation length is determined by subtracting the absolute value of the numeric argument from the number of character positions remaining on the current prompt line. If this results in a zero or negative length, a length of 1 is used. In other words, a negative argument arranges that after truncation at least *n* characters remain before the right margin (left margin for `RPROMPT`).

The forms with '`<`' truncate at the left of the string, and the forms with '`>`' truncate at the right of the string. For example, if the current directory is '`/home/pike`', the prompt '`%8<..<%/`' will expand to '`..e/pike`'. In this string, the terminating character ('`<`', '`>`' or '`]`'), or in fact any character, may be quoted by a preceding '`\`'; note when using `print -P`, however, that this must be doubled as the string is also subject to standard `print` processing, in addition to any backslashes removed by a double quoted string: the worst case is therefore '`print -P "%<\\\\<<..."`'.

If the *string* is longer than the specified truncation length, it will appear in full, completely replacing the truncated string.

The part of the prompt string to be truncated runs to the end of the string, or to the end of the next enclosing group of the '`%(`' construct, or to the next truncation encountered at the same grouping level (i.e. truncations inside a '`%(`' are separate), which ever comes first. In particular, a truncation with argument zero (e.g., '`%<<`') marks the end of the range of the string to be truncated while turning off truncation from there on. For example, the prompt '`%10<...<%~%<<%# `' will print a truncated representation of the current directory, followed by a '`%`' or '`#`', followed by a space. Without the '`%<<`', those two characters would be included in the string to be truncated. Note that '`%-0<<`' is not equivalent to '`%<<`' but specifies that the prompt is truncated at the right margin.

Truncation applies only within each individual line of the prompt, as delimited by embedded newlines (if any). If the total length of any line of the prompt after truncation is greater than the terminal width, or if the part to be truncated contains embedded newlines, truncation behavior is undefined and may change in a future version of the shell. Use '`%-`*n*`(l.`*true-text*`.`*false-text*`)`' to remove parts of the prompt when the available space is less than *n*.

[Releases](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/releases)

#### Take image

raspistill -o /home/pi/Pictures/test.jpg

Flags:
- `-o` Output [Directory]
- `-vf` Vertical Flip
- `-hf` Horizontal Flip

#### Rebooting

`systemctl reboot -i`
or
`sudo reboot`

#### List network interface

`ip link show`

Show interface summary in a table
`netstat -i`

`ifconfig`


What you will need, in order to be able to establish this connection, are the following:

`ifconfig`: Enable your wireless device.
`iwlist`: List the available wireless access points.
`iwconfig`: Configure your wireless connection.
`dhclient`: Get your IP Address via dhcp.
`wpa_supplicant`: For use with WPA authentication.

Make sure you have all of the above tools o  your computer before you continue. To test for this tools you can, from within your terminal window, issue the commands:

which ifconfig
which iwlist
which iwconfig
which dhclient
which wpa_supplicant


`ifconfig wlan0 up`

Where wlan0 is the name of your wireless device (this is most often the default). The above command will bring your wireless device up so it is ready to use. 

scan for any wireless access points with the command:

`iwlist wlan0 scan`


ESSID: "NETWORK_NAME"

iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key WIRELESS_KEY

Where NETWORK_NAME is the name of the network you want to connect to and WIRELESS_KEY is the security key for that network. NOTE: The iwconfig command defaults to HEX values for wireless keys. If you need to use ascii you have to prepend the “s” prefix to your key like so:

iwconfig wlan0 essid NETWORK_NAME key s:WIRELESS_KEY

With your connection made, you now have to get an IP address for your machine using the dhclient command like:

dhclient wlan0

#### "Unable to resolve hostname "hostname"

Then run:

```bash
cp /lib/udev/rules.d/73-usb-net-by-mac.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

#### sudo (Superuser DO)

Get a root shell `sudo -i`
sudo -s for a non-login shell.
run a non interactive shell using root access: `sudo bash -c 'echo something >> /etc/somewhere/file'`

#### Print a file to the terminal

in otherwords see whats in a file

`cat [file]`

#### Append a line to a file

`>` Writes to a file (overwrites)
`>>` Appends

So youd think

```bash
sudo nano /home/test.txt
hello world
#Save and exit
"hello again" >> /home/test.txt
#would work, but it doesnt.  Permission denied

sudo echo "hello again" >> /home/test.txt
#correct syntax at least, still permission denied.   This is because sudo applies to echo not the write to file

#so either get a root shell
sudo -i
#or use `tee`

echo "hello again" | sudo tee /home/test.txt
echo "hello again" | sudo tee -a /home/test.txt

```

## Enhanced HyperV Session

[Source](https://francescotonini.medium.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-20-04-on-hyper-v-with-enhanced-session-b20a269a5fa7)

[Author is here, though deprecated.](https://github.com/Microsoft/linux-vm-tools?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha)


Running through windows quick connect has an image with it built in.  

Last official release was 18.03, unofficial with 20.04?




Setup enhanced session
On Ubuntu, open a terminal, download and run the setup script.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/linux-vm-tools/master/ubuntu/18.04/install.sh
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
If you receive an error at the end of the install script, there is one more thing to do. Using your favorite editor, open /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini (sudo required) and add or edit the following lines:
port=vsock://-1:3389
use_vsock=false
Save the file and shutdown the VM. From Windows, open a PowerShell prompt with admin privileges and type:
Set-VM -VMName <your_vm_name>  -EnhancedSessionTransportType HvSocket
where <your_vm_name> is, well, the name of the VM (the one chosen at the start of the creation wizard).
There you go! Now start the VM and in a matter of seconds you will be redirected to the XRDP login page.
