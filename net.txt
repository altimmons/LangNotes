NAMES
The following types of names are used with Windows:

Computername      A unique name that identifies a computer on
                  the local-area network.

Devicename        The name by which Windows identifies a disk resource
                  or printer. A disk resource is identified by a drive
                  letter followed by a colon (for example, D:). A
                  printer is identified by a port name followed by a colon
                  (for example, LPT1:).

Workgroup         A group of computers on the network. Each workgroup
                  has a unique name.

Localgroup        A group of names in a Workgroup that are granted the
                  same rights.

Domain            A group of Windows Servers, Windows Workstations
                  and other computers on the network. A
                  domain has a unique name. Usually, you must log on in
                  a domain to gain access to the network. Domains are
                  created and managed with Windows Server.

Global group      A group of names in a domain that are granted the
                  same rights.

Filename          The name of a file. Under the file allocation table
                  (FAT) file system, a filename can have as many as eight
                  characters, followed by a period (.) and an extension of
                  as many as three characters. Under NTFS and HPFS, a
                  filename can have as many as 254 characters.

Network path      A description of the location of a shared resource,
                  consisting of a computer's computername followed by
                  the sharename of the resource. The computername
                  is preceded by two backslashes, and the sharename is
                  preceded by one backslash (for example,
                  \\SERVER1\RESOURCE).

Path              The location of a directory. A path can consist of a
                  devicename and one or more directory names. A
                  backslash (\) precedes each directory name (for example,
                  C:\CUSTOMER\CORP\ACCT).

Pathname          A path and a filename. The filename is preceded by a
                  backslash (\) (for example, C:\CUSTOMER\CORP\REPORT.DOC).

Sharename         A name that identifies a shared resource on a computer. A
                  sharename is used with the computer's computername to form
                  a network path (as in \\SERVER\RESOURCE).

Username          The name a person supplies when logging on at
                  a computer.
